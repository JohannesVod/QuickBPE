Signature

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her versatile artistry, songwriting, and entrepreneurship have influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics, and her life is a subject of widespread media coverage.
Swift began professional songwriting at 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with Taylor Swift (2006). Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".
After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor's Version after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs "Cruel Summer", "Cardigan", "Willow", "Anti-Hero", "All Too Well", and "Is It Over Now?". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Swift has directed several music videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).
One of the world's best-selling musicians, with over 200 million records sold as of 2019, Swift has been named Global Recording Artist of the Year three times by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, whereas six of her albums have opened with over a million sales in a week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (featuring a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards.
Life and career
Early life

Swift's childhood home in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania
Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[6]
Swift's mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[7][8] Swift's paternal great-great-grandfather, Charles Carmine Antonio Baldi, was an Italian immigrant entrepreneur and community leader who opened several businesses in Philadelphia in the 1800s.[9][10][8] Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie (née Moehlenkamp) Finlay, was an opera singer.[11]
Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[12][13] She is a Christian.[14] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, run by Bernardine Franciscan sisters,[15] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[16] The family moved to a rented house in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[17] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[18]
At age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[19] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[20] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything".[21] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[22][23] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[24] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[25] She was rejected, however, because "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different."[26] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[27][28]
When Swift was around 12 years old, musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write "Lucky You".[29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York–based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[12][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36][37]
2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album
In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[38][39] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[40] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[41] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[42] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][23] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[43]

At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[45] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[46][47] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[23] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[48] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[49] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her "honesty, intelligence and idealism".[50] The album peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[51] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[52]
Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[53] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[54] as a replacement for Eric Church.[55] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[53][12]
Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. With "Our Song", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[56] "Teardrops on My Guitar" reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100.[57] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[58][59] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[60] Brad Paisley,[61] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[62]
Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[63] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[64] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[65] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[66] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[67] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[68] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[69][70]
2008–2010: Fearless

Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008, in North America,[73] and in March 2009 in other markets.[74] Critics lauded Swift's honest and vulnerable songwriting in contrast to other teenage singers.[75] Five singles were released in 2008–2009: "Love Story", "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen", and "Fearless". The first single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one in Australia.[57][76] It was the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart.[77] "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two,[78] and was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[79] All five singles were Hot Country Songs top-10 entries, with "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" topping the chart.[80] Fearless became her first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and 2009's top-selling album in the US.[81] The Fearless Tour, Swift's first headlining concert tour, grossed over $63 million.[82] Journey to Fearless, a documentary miniseries, aired on television and was later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[83] Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour in 2009.[84]
In 2009, the music video for "You Belong with Me" was named Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[85] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West,[86] an incident that became the subject of controversy, widespread media attention and Internet memes.[87] That year she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[88] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[89] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for "Love Story" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called "Thug Story".[90] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist to win Album of the Year.[note 1] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[93]
Swift featured on John Mayer's single "Half of My Heart" and Boys Like Girls' single "Two Is Better Than One", the latter of which she co-wrote.[94][95] She co-wrote and recorded "Best Days of Your Life" with Kellie Pickler,[96] and wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack—"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier".[72] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single "Today Was a Fairytale", which was her first number-one on the Canadian Hot 100 and peaked at number two on the US Hot 100.[97][98] While shooting her film debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[99] In 2009, she made her television debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode,[100] and she hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[101][102]
2010–2014: Speak Now and Red

In August 2010, Swift released "Mine", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. The single entered the Hot 100 at number three.[103] Swift wrote the album alone and co-produced every track.[104] The album was released on October 25, 2010,[105] opening atop the Billboard 200 with over one million copies sold.[106] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week.[107] Critics appreciated Swift's grown-up perspectives:[108] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote, "in a mere four years, the 20-year-old Nashville firecracker has put her name on three dozen or so of the smartest songs released by anyone in pop, rock or country."[109] "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly", and "Ours" became subsequent singles, with the latter two reaching number one on the Hot Country Songs[80] and the first two peaking in the top ten in Canada.[98] She dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010.[110]
At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance for "Mean", which she performed during the ceremony.[111] Swift won other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[112][113] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[114] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[115] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[116] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[117] Rolling Stone named Speak Now amongst its "50 Best Female Albums of All Time" (2012), writing: "She might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click."[118]
The Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million,[119] followed up by the live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[120] She contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: "Eyes Open" and "Safe & Sound", co-written and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. "Safe & Sound" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[121][122] Swift featured on B.o.B's single "Both of Us", released in May 2012.[123] She dated Conor Kennedy that year.[124]

In August 2012, Swift released "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red. It became her first number one single in the US and New Zealand,[125][126] and became the fastest-selling single in digital history.[127] Other singles from the album were "Begin Again", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "22", "Everything Has Changed", "The Last Time", and "Red". "I Knew You Were Trouble" reached the top five on charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the US.[128] "Begin Again", "22", and "Red" reached the top 20 in the US.[57] On Red, released on October 22, 2012,[129] Swift worked with Chapman and Rose, as well as the new producers Max Martin and Shellback.[130] It incorporated many pop and rock styles such as heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop.[131] Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times said Swift "strives for something much more grand and accomplished" with Red.[132] It opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales.[133] Red was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[134] It earned several accolades, including four nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[135] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[136][137] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[138] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150 million, becoming the highest-grossing country tour ever.[139] Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient of the accolade after Garth Brooks.[140] During this time, she briefly dated the English singer Harry Styles.[141]
In 2013, Swift recorded "Sweeter than Fiction", a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance soundtrack. The song received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[142] She provided guest vocals for Tim McGraw's song "Highway Don't Care", also featuring Keith Urban.[143] Swift performed "As Tears Go By" with the Rolling Stones in Chicago, Illinois, as part of the band's 50 & Counting tour,[144] and joined Florida Georgia Line at their set at the 2013 Country Radio Seminar to sing "Cruise".[145] Swift voiced Audrey in the animated film The Lorax (2012),[146] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[147] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[148]
2014–2018: 1989 and Reputation

In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City.[note 2] She hired Tree Paine as her publicist[151] and worked on her fifth studio album, 1989, with the producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[152] She promoted the album extensively, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions.[153] 1989 was released on October 27, 2014, and opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[154] Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" reached number one in Australia, Canada and the US, the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot;[155] other singles include "Style", "Wildest Dreams", "Out of the Woods" and "New Romantics".[156] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[157]
Prior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[158] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that its ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[159] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[160] The following day, Apple Inc. announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[161] and Swift agreed to let 1989 on the streaming service.[162] She then returned her entire catalog plus 1989 to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play and other digital streaming platforms in June 2017.[163] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[164] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[165] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015, and broke museum attendance records.[166][167] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[168] The video for "Bad Blood" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[169] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice.[170]

Swift dated the Scottish DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[171] They co-wrote the song "This Is What You Came For", featuring vocals from the Barbadian singer Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[172] In April 2016, Swift criticized the lyrics of Kanye West's single "Famous", in which he sings "I made that bitch famous" in reference to his interruption of her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. West claimed he had received her approval for the line, and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the single amicably over the phone; a full recording leaked in 2020 established that West did not disclose that he would call her a "bitch".[173][174]
After briefly dating the English actor Tom Hiddleston,[175] Swift entered a six-year relationship with the English actor Joe Alwyn in September 2016.[176][177][178] She wrote the song "Better Man" for the band Little Big Town, which earned her the Song of the Year award at the 51st CMA Awards.[179] Swift and English singer Zayn Malik released the joint single "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" for Fifty Shades Darker: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017). The song reached number two in the US.[180]
In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[181] Also that month, after a one-year hiatus from the spotlight, Swift cleared her social media accounts and released "Look What You Made Me Do" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[182][183] The single was Swift's first UK number-one single.[184] It topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[185] Reputation, released on November 10, 2017,[186] incorporated electropop, hip hop, R&B, and EDM.[187] Reviews praised Swift's mature artistry, but some denounced the themes of fame and gossip.[188] The album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[189] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[190] Its singles "...Ready for It?", "End Game" (featuring Ed Sheeran and Future), and "Delicate" were released to pop radio.[191] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[192] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's "Babe" (2018).[193]
At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[194] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[195] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[196]
2018–2020: Lover, Folklore, and Evermore
In November 2018, she signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group; her subsequent releases were promoted by Republic Records. Swift said the contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[197] Vox called it a huge commitment from Universal, which was "far from assured" until Swift intervened.[198]

Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released on August 23, 2019.[199] Besides Antonoff, she worked with Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[200] Lover was her sixth consecutive album to sell more than 500,000 US copies in one week.[201] Critics commended the album's free-spirited mood and emotional intimacy.[202][203] The singles "Me!" and "You Need to Calm Down" both peaked at number two on the Hot 100,[204] and other singles were the top-10 single "Lover", the top-40 single "The Man",[57] and the 2023 resurgent success, chart topper "Cruel Summer".[205] Lover was the world's best-selling album by a solo artist of 2019,[206] and along with its singles earned nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[207] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, "Me!" won Best Visual Effects, and "You Need to Calm Down" won Video of the Year and Video for Good. Swift was the first female and second artist overall to win Video of the Year for a video that they directed.[208]
While promoting Lover, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun and Big Machine over the purchase of the masters of her back catalog.[209][210] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[209][211] Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020.[212] Besides music, she played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful Ghosts".[213][214] Critics panned the film but praised Swift's performance.[215] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[216] Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group in February 2020 after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[217]
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two "sister albums" that she recorded with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore on July 24, and Evermore on December 11.[218][219] Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[220] Both explore indie folk with a more muted production compared to her previous upbeat pop songs[221][222] and earned Swift widespread critical acclaim and artistic recognition.[223][224] Each album was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[225] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards[226] and was the best-selling album of 2020 in the US.[227] Swift became the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore's "Cardigan".[228] At the 2020 American Music Awards, she won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[229] According to Billboard, she was 2020's highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide.[230]

Following the masters dispute, Swift released re-recordings of her first six studio albums, beginning with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) in April and November 2021, respectively. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200,[231] and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[232] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", which made her the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[233] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[234] The song was accompanied by a short film, which won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video[235] and Swift's record third MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[236]
Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022.[237] Characterized by a restrained electropop[238][239] and synth-pop[240] sound, the album was dubbed by Rolling Stone critics as an instant classic.[241][242] The album was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies and broke various sales and streaming records,[243] including the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify.[244] Its tracks, led by single "Anti-Hero", monopolized the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to do so.[245] Two other singles, "Lavender Haze" and "Karma", peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[246] Swift won nine awards at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year ("Anti-Hero") for a record fourth time.[247] At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, she received Best Pop Vocal Album, and her fourth Album of the Year—the most for any artist.[248]
Swift released the third re-recorded album, Speak Now (Taylor's Version), on July 7, 2023, becoming the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand.[249] 1989 (Taylor's Version), released on October 27, 2023, became Swift's record-extending sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US and surpassed Midnights for her career's largest album sales week.[250] Its single "Is It Over Now?" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100. Swift was 2023's most streamed artist on Spotify,[251] Apple Music,[252] and Amazon Music;[253] the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023);[254] and the first living artist to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200.[255] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the United States, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[256][257]
Beyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: "Renegade" and "Birch" by Big Red Machine,[258] a remix of "Gasoline" by Haim,[259] "The Joker and the Queen" by Ed Sheeran,[260] and "The Alcott" by the National.[261] For the soundtrack of the 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, she recorded "Carolina", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[262] Outside of music, Swift had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam and has signed to direct an upcoming feature film for Searchlight Pictures.[263][264]

Swift on the Eras Tour in 2023
In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's cultural and economic impact,[265] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[245] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[266] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion.[267][268] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[269][270] Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[271] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a "new stratosphere of global career success" in 2023.[272]
Swift began dating Kansas City Chiefs' tight end Travis Kelce in 2023.[273] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to X (formerly Twitter) and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[274][275] At the 66th Grammy Awards, Swift announced her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, set for release on April 19, 2024.[248][276]
Artistry
Influences
One of Swift's earliest memories of music is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[5] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own."[277] Swift said she owes her confidence and "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[278][279]
Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[280] which was introduced to the genre by female country artists of the 1990s: Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[281][282] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[283] Hill was Swift's childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[284] She admired the Chicks' defiant attitude and the way they played their instruments,[285] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[22] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[114] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell's emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell's 1971 album Blue as a favorite "because it explores somebody's soul so deeply".[286] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette,[287][288] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[289] and Lori McKenna.[290]
Various pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[12][291] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[292][293] She also cited Keith Urban's musical style and Fall Out Boy's lyrics as major influences.[294][295]
Genres
"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur."
—The Recording Academy, 2021[296]
Swift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[297][264] having been described as a "music chameleon".[298][299] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red.[300] Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock[301][302] and said that the melodies of her songs were rooted in pop, and the country music elements were limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang.[303][304] Some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[305][306] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift's status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in mainstream pop.[307][308] Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, "I leave the genre labeling to other people."[309]
Music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop".[310] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first "documented, official pop album".[311] Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[312][313][314] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, "subdued and amorphous pop sound".[315][316] Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[317][318] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.[319] Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[320][321] Clash said her career "has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing", reaching a point at which "Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift", not defined by any genre.[322]

Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[325] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[326][327] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[328] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[329] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing "intimacy over power and nuance".[330] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[331]
The Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow".[332] With Reputation, critics noted she was "learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own",[333] swapping her "signature" expressive vocals for "cool, conversational, detached" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[334][335][336] Alternative Press stated that her "evocative" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[337]
Reviews of Swift's later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[304][338][339] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[340][341][342] Pitchfork described it as "versatile and expressive".[343] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and "fuller" tone of her voice.[344][345][346] An i review said Swift's voice is "leagues better now".[347] The Guardian highlighted "yo-yoing vocal yelps" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice,[348] and that her country twang faded away.[349] Midnights received acclaim for Swift's nuanced vocal delivery.[350] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[327] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals.[351] Musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift's timbre is "breathy and bright" in her upper register and "full and dark" in the lower.[222]
Songwriting
Further information: List of songs by Taylor Swift
Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[352][353][354] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare amongst her peers.[355][356] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[357][358] earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time.[359] Mojo described her as "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor".[360]
In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[12] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[361][362] Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[363][364] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[365][366] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[367] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[292] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[368] and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love".[369] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[370][371] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[279][372]
Her confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[373][12][374] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[375][376][377] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[378][379] NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",[335] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures".[379] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[12] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[380][381][382] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[383]
On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[384] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[363] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[384] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore.[385] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".[358]
Swift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[386] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most "emotionally vulnerable" of the album.[387] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today".[388] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[389] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[245] Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me".[390]
Performances

Swift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018
Journalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[391][392][393][394][395] Swift commands large audiences,[396][397][398] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[399] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whether she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers".[400] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."[401] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour,[402] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled".[403]
Critics have highlighted Swift's versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[404][405] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[406] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[407] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[408] acoustic guitar; piano;[409] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[410][411] banjo,[412] or ukulele.[413] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[351][414] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins".[415][409] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop's most approachable superstar",[416] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[417]
Video and film
Further information: Taylor Swift videography
Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[418] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011[419] and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before.[420] In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes."[421]
From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[422] She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[423] Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[424]
Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[425] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch,[426] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[427] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[245] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[428] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[418]

Cultural status
Main articles: Cultural impact of Taylor Swift and Public image of Taylor Swift

Swift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala
Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture and the economy.[486][487] She dominates cultural conversations,[488][489] which has led publications to describe her as a cultural "vitality" or zeitgeist.[490][491][492] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[297] Initially a teen idol,[493] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[312][494] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[495][496] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the "world's biggest pop star" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift "falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends", leaving her contemporaries "vying for second place".[310] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[497]
Her fans are known as Swifties.[266] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[498] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[499][500] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an "economic genius".[501]
Although labeled by the media in her early career as "America's Sweetheart" for her girl next door persona,[502][503] Swift has been accused by detractors of being "calculated" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and "slut-shaming",[504][505] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[506]
Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[507][508] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[509][510] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, citing safety concerns and stalking.[511][512] Swift has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[513][514]
Legacy
"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact."
– Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[515]
Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[516] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[310][516] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][53] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[517][310] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[518] her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[519][520]
According to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[521] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[522] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[523] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[355][524] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album "eras".[525][526] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[297] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.[527][297]

Das Wort Mensch ist im Althochdeutschen seit dem 8. Jahrhundert in der Schreibung mennisco (Maskulinum) belegt und im Mittelhochdeutschen in der Schreibung mensch(e) (Maskulinum oder Neutrum) in der Bedeutung „Mensch“. Das Wort ist eine Substantivierung von althochdeutsch mennisc, mittelhochdeutsch mennisch für „mannhaft“ und wird zurückgeführt auf einen indogermanischen Wortstamm, in dem die Bedeutung Mann und Mensch in eins fiel – heute noch erhalten in man. Das Neutrum (das Mensch) hatte bis ins 17. Jahrhundert keinen abfälligen Beiklang und bezeichnete bis dahin insbesondere Frauen von niederem gesellschaftlichen Rang.[2]

Der Name der Art Homo sapiens (klassisch [ˈhɔmoː ˈsapieːns], gebräuchliche Aussprache [ˈhoːmo ˈzaːpiəns], nach lat. homo sapiens ‚einsichtsfähiger/weiser Mensch‘) wurde 1758 durch Carl von Linné in der zehnten Auflage seines Werks Systema Naturae geprägt. Auch im aktuellen Catalog of Life des Integrated Taxonomic Information System wird die Bezeichnung „Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758“ als „akzeptierter wissenschaftlicher Name“ ausgewiesen.[3] Von den 1930er-Jahren bis in die 1990er-Jahre wurde der Mensch als Homo sapiens sapiens und der Neandertaler als Homo sapiens neanderthalensis bezeichnet. Diese Einordnung des Neandertalers als Unterart von Homo sapiens gilt jedoch derzeit als veraltet, da es seitdem unter Paläoanthropologen „eine zunehmende Akzeptanz, dass die Neandertaler morphologisch unverwechselbar sind,“ gibt und sich daher in der Fachliteratur die Bezeichnungen Homo sapiens und Homo neanderthalensis durchgesetzt haben.[4]

Merkmale des Körpers
→ Hauptartikel: Menschlicher Körper

Der Körper des Menschen: Beispielhaft eine Frau und ein Mann, von vorne und hinten betrachtet.
Mit dem Körper des Menschen befassen sich unter anderem die Anatomie, die Humanbiologie und die Medizin. Die Anzahl der Knochen des Menschen beträgt (individuell verschieden) beim Erwachsenen 206 bis 214. Das Skelett von Säuglingen hat noch mehr als 300 Knochen, von denen einige im Laufe der Zeit zusammenwachsen.

Die Körpergröße des Menschen ist zum Teil vererbt, hängt jedoch auch von Lebensumständen wie der Ernährung ab. Auch das Geschlecht spielt eine Rolle: Männer sind im Durchschnitt größer als Frauen. Seit dem 19. Jahrhundert ist die durchschnittliche Körpergröße in Mitteleuropa bzw. Deutschland von 167,6 cm (Männer) / 155,7 cm (Frauen)[5] auf 178 cm (Männer) / 165 cm (Frauen)[6] angestiegen.

Für das Körpergewicht des Menschen gibt es keinen medizinischen Konsens, was als „wünschenswert“ oder „natürlich“ gelten sollte, zumal das Körpergewicht auch von der Körpergröße abhängig ist. Gleichwohl hat die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) hilfsweise anhand des Body-Mass-Index (BMI) einen Normbereich (normal range) definiert, der einen BMI von 18,50 bis 24,99 umfasst.[7]

Im Folgenden werden einige der wichtigsten Merkmale der Spezies, insbesondere im Vergleich zu anderen Menschenaffen und sonstigen Primaten, genannt.

Aufrechter Gang
→ Hauptartikel: Bipedie

Darstellung der Evolution des aufrechten Gangs (angelehnt an den „March of Progress“ von Rudolph Zallinger)
Der Mensch besitzt einen aufrechten Gang (Bipedie), was in der Tierwelt an sich nichts Ungewöhnliches, jedoch bei den Säugetieren selten ist. Der aufrechte Gang ermöglicht dem Menschen das zweibeinige Stehen, Gehen, Laufen. Er hat damit zwei Gangarten. Gerade im Säuglingsalter hat er aber noch ein großes Repertoire weiterer Bewegungsabläufe (krabbeln) und kann auch eigene entwickeln (z. B. Hopserlauf).

Der Mensch besitzt keinen Greiffuß wie die meisten anderen Primaten, sondern einen Fuß mit verkürzten Zehen und anliegender Großzehe. Dafür dient die Hand des Menschen nicht mehr zur Fortbewegung. Untypisch für einen Affen sind beim Menschen die Arme kürzer als die Beine. Wie bei allen Menschenartigen fehlt der Schwanz. Eine weitere Folge der Entwicklung des aufrechten Gangs beim Menschen ist seine doppelt-S-förmige Wirbelsäule und das kräftig ausgebildete Gesäß, welches die aufrechte Haltung und Fortbewegung erst ermöglicht.

Der aufrechte Gang muss erst individuell erlernt werden, was etwa ein bis eineinhalb Jahre ab der Geburt dauert.

Gehirn

Rotationsanimiertes Modell eines menschlichen Gehirns (ohne rechtes Großhirn; Frontallappen rot markiert)
Das menschliche Gehirn entspricht in seinem Aufbau dem Gehirn anderer Primaten, ist jedoch im Verhältnis zur Körpergröße größer.[8][9] Die Anzahl der Nervenzellen im Gehirn eines erwachsenen Menschen beträgt etwa 86 Milliarden, in der Rinde des Großhirns etwa 16 Milliarden.[9][10] Im Vergleich dazu hat das Gehirn eines Rhesusaffen ca. 6,4 Milliarden Nervenzellen[11] und das Gehirn eines Elefanten ca. 257 Milliarden, davon 5,6 Milliarden in der Großhirnrinde (Cortex cerebri).[12] Doch beim Grindwal beträgt die Neuronenanzahl allein im Neocortex ca. 37 Milliarden, also etwa doppelt so viel wie beim Menschen.[13]

Die Großhirnrinde ist am menschlichen Gehirn besonders stark ausgeprägt, insbesondere die Frontallappen, denen exekutive Funktionen wie Impulskontrolle, emotionale Regulation, Aufmerksamkeitssteuerung, zielgerichtetes Initiieren und Sequenzieren von Handlungen, motorische Steuerung, Beobachtung der Handlungsergebnisse und Selbstkorrektur zugeordnet werden. Der Bereich der Großhirnrinde, der für das Sehen zuständig ist, sowie Zonen, die für die Sprache eine Rolle spielen, sind ebenfalls beim Menschen deutlich vergrößert.

Anhand von Fossilienfunden ist belegbar, dass sich der aufrechte zweibeinige Gang des Menschen deutlich früher entwickelte als die starke Vergrößerung des Gehirns.[14] Die Vergrößerung des Gehirns ereignete sich zeitgleich mit einer Verkleinerung der Kaumuskulatur.

Das Gesicht des Menschen ist flacher als bei einem Menschenaffen-Schädel, der eine hervorstehende Schnauze hat. Hingegen hat der Mensch durch die Rücknahme des Ober- und Unterkiefers ein vorspringendes Kinn. Mit der starken Zunahme des Gehirnvolumens entstand eine hohe Stirn und seine charakteristische Schädelform.

Haut und Behaarung
Der Mensch verfügt in besonderem Maße über die Fähigkeit der Wärmeabfuhr durch Schwitzen. Kein anderer Primat besitzt eine so hohe Dichte an Schweißdrüsen wie der Mensch. Die Kühlung des Körpers durch Schwitzen wird unterstützt durch die Eigenheit, dass der Mensch im Unterschied zu den meisten Säugetieren kein (dichtes) Fell hat. Während seine Körperbehaarung nur gering ausgebildet ist, wächst sein Kopfhaar ohne natürlich begrenzte Länge. Ein Teil der verbliebenen Körperbehaarung entwickelt sich erst in der Pubertät: das Scham- und Achselhaar sowie die Brustbehaarung und das Barthaar beim Mann.

Eine Folge der Felllosigkeit ist die rasche Auskühlung bei Kälte aufgrund der geringeren Wärmeisolation. Der Mensch lernte jedoch, dies durch das Nutzen von Feuer und das Anfertigen von Behausungen und Kleidung zu kompensieren. Beides ermöglicht ihm auch das Überleben in kälteren Regionen. Ein weiterer Nachteil der Felllosigkeit ist das erhöhte Risiko für die Haut, durch ultraviolettes Licht geschädigt zu werden, da Fell einen wichtigen Sonnenschutz darstellt. Die je nach Herkunftsregion unterschiedliche Hautfarbe wird als Anpassung an die – je nach geographischer Breite – unterschiedlich intensive Einstrahlung des von der Sonne kommenden ultravioletten Lichts interpretiert (→ Evolution der Hautfarben beim Menschen).

Lebensweise
Ernährung und Gebiss
→ Hauptartikel: Ernährung des Menschen
Nach heutigem Kenntnisstand ist der Mensch „von Natur aus“ weder ein reiner Fleischfresser (Carnivore) noch ein reiner Pflanzenfresser (Herbivore), sondern ein so genannter Allesfresser (Omnivore); umstritten ist allerdings, welcher Anteil der Nahrungsaufnahme in den verschiedenen Zeiten und Regionen auf Fleisch und auf Pflanzenkost entfiel.[15] Die omnivore Lebensweise erleichterte es dem Menschen, sich nahezu jedes Ökosystem der Erde als Lebensraum zu erschließen.[16]

Der Mensch besitzt ein Allesfressergebiss mit parabelförmig angeordneten Zahnreihen. Wie die meisten Säugetiere vollzieht er einen Zahnwechsel. Das Milchgebiss des Menschen hat 20 Zähne, das bleibende Gebiss 32 (inklusive Weisheitszähne). Die Zahnformel des Menschen ist wie bei allen Altweltaffen I2-C1-P2-M3. Der Mensch hat jedoch verkleinerte Schneide- und Eckzähne.

Sexualität
→ Hauptartikel: Sexualität des Menschen
Die Fruchtbarkeit (die Geschlechtsreife mit dem Erreichen der Menarche bzw. Spermarche) beginnt beim Menschen deutlich später als bei anderen (auch langlebigen) Primaten.

Eine Besonderheit der menschlichen Sexualität ist der versteckte Eisprung. Während die Fruchtbarkeit bei weiblichen Säugetieren in der Regel durch körperliche oder Verhaltens-Signale mitgeteilt wird, damit in dieser Phase eine Befruchtung stattfinden kann, ist sie beim Menschen „versteckt“. Deshalb ist der Geschlechtsakt beim Menschen weniger stark mit der Fortpflanzung verbunden. Das Sexualverhalten des Menschen hat über die Rekombination von Genen hinaus zahlreiche soziale Funktionen; es gibt mehrere sexuelle Orientierungen.

Eine weitere Besonderheit ist die Menopause bei der Frau. Bei vielen Tierarten sind Männchen und Weibchen in aller Regel bis zu ihrem Tode fruchtbar. Nur bei wenigen Tierarten ist die Fruchtbarkeit des Weibchens zeitlich begrenzt.

Fortpflanzung
→ Hauptartikel: Menschliche Fortpflanzung

Neugeborener Mensch
Die Fortpflanzung des Menschen hängt vom generativen Verhalten ab.

Die Schwangerschaft, wie die Trächtigkeit beim Menschen genannt wird, beträgt von der Befruchtung bis zur Geburt durchschnittlich 266 Tage.[17]

Wegen des großen Gehirnvolumens des Menschen bei gleichzeitigen durch den aufrechten Gang bestimmten Anforderungen an seinen Beckenboden und die relative Enge des Geburtskanals ist die Geburt besonders problematisch: Eine menschliche Geburt kann weit schmerzhafter sein als bei anderen Tieren, auch im Vergleich mit anderen Primaten, und kann auch leichter zu Komplikationen führen. Um deren Auftreten zu verringern und bereits aufgetretene behandeln zu können, wurden die Methoden der Geburtshilfe entwickelt.

Neugeborene kommen in einem besonders unreifen und hilflosen Zustand auf die Welt. Die Säuglinge verfügen in den ersten Lebensmonaten lediglich über (Neugeborenen-)Reflexe. Sie können sich nicht eigenständig fortbewegen und sind daher weitgehend passive Traglinge.

Lebenserwartung
→ Hauptartikel: Lebenserwartung
Der Mensch zählt zu den langlebigsten Tieren und ist die langlebigste Spezies unter den Primaten.

Neben genetischen Anlagen spielen die Qualität der medizinischen Versorgung, Stress, Ernährung und Bewegung wichtige Rollen bei der menschlichen Lebenserwartung. Frauen haben im Durchschnitt eine um mehrere Jahre höhere Lebenserwartung als Männer. Die Lebenserwartung hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten in den meisten Ländern der Erde kontinuierlich verlängert. Unter guten Rahmenbedingungen können Menschen 100 Jahre und älter werden.

Taxonomie und Genetik
Taxonomie

Stammbaum der Menschenaffen (Hominidae)

Stammbaum der archaischen Verwandten (Gattung Homo) des Menschen bis zur Gegenwart (Homo sapiens).
Zahlen links: Alter in Millionen Jahren
Bis in die späten 1980er-Jahre wurden die Orang-Utans, Gorillas und Schimpansen in der Familie der Menschenaffen (Pongidae) zusammengefasst und der Familie der Echten Menschen (Hominidae) gegenübergestellt. Genetische Vergleiche zeigten, dass Schimpansen und Gorillas näher mit dem Menschen verwandt sind als mit den Orang-Utans; seitdem werden Menschen, Schimpansen und Gorillas nebst all ihren fossilen Vorfahren zur Unterfamilie Homininae und diese neben das Taxon Ponginae der Orang-Utans gestellt.

Von den anderen heute noch lebenden Menschenaffen kann Homo sapiens anhand seines Genotyps unterschieden werden, ferner anhand seines Phänotyps, seiner Ontogenie und seines Verhaltens. Hinzu kommen erhebliche Unterschiede in Bezug auf die Dauer bestimmter Lebensabschnitte: die Entwicklung des Säuglings vollzieht sich bei Homo sapiens langsamer als bei den anderen Menschenaffen – mit der Folge, dass der Mensch eine deutlich verlängerte Kindheit sowie Adoleszenz besitzt. Dies wiederum hat zur Folge, dass der Mensch erst relativ spät geschlechtsreif wird und der Aufwand der Eltern zugunsten ihrer Kinder sehr hoch ist; zudem ist der Abstand zwischen den Geburten geringer und die Lebenserwartung höher.[18]

Vom 18. Jahrhundert bis zum späten 20. Jahrhundert wurde die Art Homo sapiens in verschiedene Rassen oder Varietäten unterteilt (siehe Rassentheorie). Dies erwies sich jedoch ab den 1970er-Jahren aufgrund populationsgenetischer Untersuchungen als fragwürdig und gilt heute als nicht mehr haltbar. Ende der 1920er-Jahre unternahm der russische Biologe und Tierzüchter Ilja Iwanowitsch Iwanow ergebnislose Kreuzungsversuche zwischen Schimpansen und Menschen.

Siehe auch: vollständige Taxonomie des Menschen
Genetik
→ Hauptartikel: Humangenetik, Humangenomprojekt und Population (Anthropologie)
Die Erbinformation des Menschen ist im Zellkern in der DNA auf 46 Chromosomen, davon zwei Geschlechtschromosomen, gespeichert sowie in der DNA der Mitochondrien. Das menschliche Genom wurde in den Jahren 1998 bis 2005 vollständig sequenziert. Insgesamt enthält das Genom diesem Befund zufolge rund 20.000 bis 25.000 Gene und 3,2 Milliarden Basenpaare.[19][20]

Das menschliche Genom enthält (wie das jedes anderen Eukaryoten) sowohl codierende als auch nicht-codierende DNA-Sequenzen, die oftmals denjenigen verwandter Lebewesen homolog sind („gleiches“ Gen) und häufig mit den DNA-Sequenzen sehr nahe verwandter Arten – wie der anderer Menschenaffen – sogar völlig übereinstimmen. Aus der Ähnlichkeit der DNA-Sequenzen unterschiedlicher Arten lässt sich zudem deren Verwandtschaftsgrad berechnen: Auf diese Weise bestätigten genetische Analysen, dass die Schimpansenarten (Bonobos, Gemeine Schimpansen), Gorillas[21] und Orang-Utans (in dieser Reihenfolge) die nächsten rezenten Verwandten des Menschen sind.

Weitere genetische Analysen ergaben, dass die genetische Vielfalt beim Menschen, im Vergleich mit den anderen Menschenaffen, gering ist. Dieser Befund wird erklärt durch eine zeitweise sehr geringe (am Rande des Aussterbens befindliche) Population (vergleiche: Mitochondriale Eva, Adam des Y-Chromosoms).

Inzwischen wiesen mehrere Studien darauf hin, dass archaische Verwandte des Menschen in geringer Menge (1–2 %) Spuren im Genom von unterschiedlichen Populationen des Menschen der Gegenwart hinterlassen haben. Zunächst wurde das für den Neandertaler in Europa und Westasien nachgewiesen,[22][23] etwas später für den Denisova-Menschen in Südostasien[24][25] und zuletzt wurde solcher Genfluss archaischer Menschen zu Homo sapiens auch für Afrika postuliert.[26][27][28]

Das Fehlen der Diagnose

Beschreibung des Menschen in der ersten Auflage von Linnés Systema Naturæ
→ Hauptartikel: Archaischer Homo sapiens
Als Carl von Linné 1735 den Menschen in seiner Schrift Systema Naturæ dem Tierreich und in diesem der Gattung Homo zuordnete, verzichtete Linné – im Unterschied zu seiner üblichen Vorgehensweise – auf eine Diagnose, das heißt auf eine an körperlichen Merkmalen ausgerichtete, genaue Beschreibung der Gattung. Stattdessen notierte er: Nosce te ipsum („Erkenne dich selbst“) und ging demnach davon aus, dass jeder Mensch genau wisse, was ein Mensch sei. Die Gattung Homo unterteilte er in vier Varianten: Europæus, Americanus, Asiaticus sowie Africanus und gab ihnen jeweils noch Farbmerkmale bei – albescens, rubescens, fuscus und nigrans, gleichbedeutend mit hell, rötlich, braun und schwarz. 1758, in der 10. Auflage von Systema Naturæ, bezeichnete Linné den Menschen zwar erstmals auch als Homo sapiens und führte zudem diverse angebliche charakterliche und körperliche Merkmale der Varianten an, verzichtete aber weiterhin auf eine Benennung der diagnostischen Merkmale der Art.

1775 bezeichnete Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in seiner Dissertation De generis humani varietate nativa („Über die natürlichen Verschiedenheiten im Menschengeschlechte“) die von Linné eingeführten Varianten als die vier „Varietäten“ des Menschen[29] und beschrieb einige ihrer gemeinsamen Merkmale. Diese Gemeinsamkeiten führte er – mehr als 80 Jahre vor Darwins Die Entstehung der Arten – darauf zurück, dass sie einer gemeinsamen „Gattung“ entsprungen seien. Jedoch erwiesen sich auch diese Merkmale nicht als geeignet, mit ihrer Hilfe zu entscheiden, ob Fossilien der Art Homo sapiens zuzuordnen oder nicht zuzuordnen sind.

Einen Schritt weiter ging der Botaniker William Thomas Stearn und erklärte 1959 Carl von Linné selbst (Linnaeus himself) zum Lectotypus der Art Homo sapiens.[30] Diese Festlegung ist nach den heute gültigen Regeln korrekt.[31] Carl von Linnés sterbliche Überreste (sein im Dom zu Uppsala bestattetes Skelett) sind daher der nomenklatorische Typus des Homo sapiens.[32]

Dennoch fehlt auch weiterhin eine allgemein anerkannte Diagnose der Art Homo sapiens: „Unsere Art Homo sapiens war niemals Gegenstand einer formalen morphologischen Definition, die uns helfen würde, unsere Artgenossen in irgendeiner brauchbaren Weise in den dokumentierten fossilen Funden zu erkennen.“[33] Mangels klarer morphologischer Kriterien erfolgt die Zuordnung von Fossilien zu Homo sapiens häufig primär aufgrund ihres datierten Alters, eines bloßen paläontologischen Hilfskriteriums.

Entwicklungsgeschichte und Ausbreitung der Spezies

Ausbreitung des Homo sapiens (rot) über die Erde und vorausgehende Besiedelung durch Homo erectus (gelb) und Neandertaler (ocker); die Zahlen stehen für Jahre vor heute.
→ Hauptartikel: Hominisation und Stammesgeschichte des Menschen
→ Hauptartikel: Ausbreitung des Menschen und Menschheitsgeschichte
Die Entwicklung des Menschen führte vermutlich über Arten, die den nachfolgend aufgeführten Arten zumindest ähnlich gewesen sein dürften, zu Homo sapiens: Ardipithecus ramidus, Australopithecus afarensis, Homo rudolfensis / Homo habilis und Homo ergaster / Homo erectus.

315.000 Jahre alte Schädelknochen aus Marokko gelten derzeit als älteste, unbestritten dem Homo sapiens zugeordnete Fossilien.[34] Lange Zeit lebte die Art Homo sapiens in Afrika parallel zum primär europäisch und vorderasiatisch angesiedelten Neandertaler, der besonders an das Leben in gemäßigten bis arktischen Zonen angepasst war.

Zahlreiche Funde unterstützen die sogenannte Out-of-Africa-Theorie, der zufolge die Ausbreitung des Menschen während der letzten Kaltzeit vom afrikanischen Kontinent aus erfolgte. Die Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeit betrug im Schnitt 400 Meter je Jahr. Die Atlantikküste auf der Iberischen Halbinsel wurde frühestens vor 41.000 Jahren von Homo sapiens erreicht, vielleicht später.

Die alternative, früher verbreitetere Hypothese vom multiregionalen Ursprung des Menschen der Gegenwart nimmt an, dass sich der Homo sapiens in mehreren Regionen unabhängig voneinander aus dem Homo erectus entwickelt hat. Nach den molekulargenetischen Untersuchungen der jüngeren Zeit kommt dieser These allerdings nur geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit zu.

Mit der Entwicklungsgeschichte der Menschheit von ihren Anfängen bis zum Jetzt-Menschen beschäftigen sich insbesondere die Paläoanthropologie, die Archäologie und die Genetik. Neben der biologischen Evolution war für den Menschen auch seine kulturelle Entwicklung maßgebend, die sich unter anderem im Gebrauch von Werkzeugen und der gesprochenen Sprache manifestiert. Der kulturelle Entwicklungsstand der frühen Vorfahren des Menschen war zunächst über Jahrhunderttausende hinweg nahezu konstant. Erst vor rund 40.000 Jahren beschleunigten sich – nach heutigem Kenntnisstand – die kulturellen Innovationen und seit dem Aufkommen von Ackerbau und Viehhaltung greift der Mensch großräumig gestaltend in seine Umgebung ein.

Der Mensch als soziales und kulturfähiges Lebewesen
Mit der Erforschung des Menschen als kulturell und gesellschaftlich geprägtem Lebewesen befassen sich unter anderem die Anthropologie mit ihren diversen Teildisziplinen (unter anderem Sozialanthropologie, Kulturanthropologie, Philosophische Anthropologie, medizinische[35] Anthropologie, Theologische Anthropologie, Paläoanthropologie), die Sozialwissenschaften, die Philosophie und die Psychologie, die Ethnologie, aber auch Teile der Verhaltensbiologie.

Der Mensch als soziales Lebewesen
Mit der aristotelischen Charakterisierung des Menschen als Zoon politikon, als ein Lebewesen also, das von seiner Natur her auf ein soziales und politisches Miteinander bezogen und angewiesen ist, liegt eine bis heute gültige Haupteinordnung vor. So ist das neugeborene Menschenkind in besonderer Intensität und Dauer auf die umfassende Fürsorge seiner Sozialpartner angewiesen, um leben und sich entwickeln zu können. Nur in menschlicher Gemeinschaft kann es die Lernanreize erhalten und verarbeiten, die es zur Teilnahme am gesellschaftlichen Leben befähigen. Mit dem Spracherwerb verbindet sich das Hineinwachsen in eine bestimmte Ausprägung menschlicher Kultur, die aus den Traditionen des jeweiligen Sozialverbands hervorgegangen ist. Indem das Bewusstsein so gearteter gesellschaftsspezifischer Traditionen in der Generationenfolge mündlich und schriftlich weitergegeben werden kann, entstehen Geschichte und Geschichtsbewusstsein. In Anpassung an bzw. in Auseinandersetzung mit seiner natürlichen und sozialen Umwelt formt sich das Individuum und gelangt zu seiner Stellung in der menschlichen Gesellschaft.

Sozialität als Folge biologischer Evolutionsmerkmale
In dem der Menschwerdung zugrunde liegenden Evolutionsprozess sind einige die körperliche Entwicklung betreffende Merkmale von besonderer Bedeutung: Mit dem aufrechten Gang werden die vorderen Extremitäten zur Fortbewegung nicht mehr gebraucht und können so vielfältigen Zwecken dienen. Die menschliche Hand vermag nicht nur kräftig zuzupacken, sondern eignet sich auch für diverse Formen feinfühliger Präzisionsarbeit. Das so begründete differenzierte Zusammenwirken von Auge und Hand führt beim Menschen zum Vorrang des Gesichts- und Tastsinns gegenüber dem Geruchssinn. Der zum Greifen nicht mehr benötigte Kieferapparat springt noch weniger schnauzenartig vor als bei den anderen Primaten und ermöglicht mit den anderen an der Stimmerzeugung beteiligten Organen eine differenzierte Lautbildung.[36]

Im Vergleich mit den Tragzeiten höherer Säugerarten findet die Menschengeburt auffällig früh statt. Zu erwarten wären 21-monatige Schwangerschaften, weshalb Adolf Portmann das erste menschliche Lebensjahr als „extra-uterines Jahr des Embryo“ bezeichnet hat, in dem die Nachreifung und die Anlage wichtiger Lebensfunktionen erst noch stattfinden.[37] Denn bei der Geburt sind die Nervenzellen im Gehirn zwar weitestgehend angelegt, aber in manchen Hirnarealen noch unverbunden. Die von den Sinnesorganen aufgenommenen Signale konfigurieren nun erst große Teile der Großhirnrinde. Nur in diesem frühen Stadium kann beispielsweise das Sehen erlernt werden, wie Erfahrungen mit Blindgeborenen gezeigt haben.[38] Im Vergleich zu hinsichtlich ihrer Organfunktionen und Antriebe weitgehend lebensfähig geborenen Tieren ist der Mensch das unfertige, instinktreduzierte, auf Lernen und auf mitmenschliche Zuwendung angewiesene, von Natur aus „nicht festgestellte“ (Friedrich Nietzsche) und deshalb weltoffene Lebewesen.

Das bei vielen Tieren ausgeprägte Reiz-Reaktionsschema gilt für den Menschen nicht in gleicher Weise. Zwischen Signal und Reaktion, zwischen Bedürfnis und Befriedigung besteht für Menschen die Möglichkeit, Abstand herzustellen, den Reiz-Reaktions-Automatismus zu durchbrechen und variabel zu reagieren und zu handeln. Der Mensch lebt nicht in „geschlossenen Funktionskreisen, sondern in offenen Handlungskreisen.“[39] Die Kognitionsfähigkeit ermöglicht es ihm, die Bedingtheit seiner Erkenntnisse als Konsequenz des mit bestimmter Ausstattung versehenen eigenen Sinnesapparats sowie der zerebralen Verarbeitungsweisen einzuschätzen.

Die Erwägung von Handlungsoptionen und die Prüfung von Alternativen bestimmen das menschliche Verhaltensrepertoire aber nicht allein. Ein Großteil der Alltagsverrichtungen ist so gewohnt und eingeübt, dass sich ein Nachdenken darüber in der Regel erübrigt. Die mit den Routinen verbundene Entlastung ist gewissermaßen die sichere Verhaltensgrundlage, die der Reflexion von Handlungsoptionen und -alternativen erst Raum verschafft.

Für orientierende Anreize zur eigenen Verhaltensentwicklung ist das Neugeborene aber für lange Zeit auf die Zuwendung seiner Bezugspersonen und auf Interaktion mit ihnen angewiesen. Vor allem durch Nachahmung entsteht dabei Gemeinsamkeit und wird das Menschenkind Teil der Gemeinschaft; in Trotz und Abgrenzung erfährt es sich als eigenständig.

Sprache als Bewusstseinsbildner
Als conditio humana schlechthin, durch die sich der Mensch von allen anderen Lebewesen unterscheidet, gilt von alters her die Sprache. Ihre Anfänge liegen wohl 100.000 bis 200.000 Jahre zurück. Eine ausgebildete Sprachfähigkeit wird etwa vor 35.000 Jahren angenommen, zur Zeit der Höhlenmalereien von Lascaux.[40] Die angeborene Sprachfähigkeit muss wie das Sehen frühzeitig erlernt werden; im fortgeschrittenen Alter ist das originäre Sprachlernen nicht mehr möglich. Jede der etwa 6.000 Sprachen besteht aus einem Vorrat aus Laut-Zeichen und aus Regeln zur Kombination dieser Zeichen. Dabei handelt es sich nicht um eine starre Struktur, sondern um eine im Gebrauch veränderliche.[41]

Die jeder anderen Form der sprachlichen Äußerung vorausgehende gesprochene Sprache aktiviert zugleich das Hören, das eigene und das des Gegenübers. „Die in der Struktur des menschlichen Körpers begründete Bindung der Sprache an die Stimme und das Ohr ermöglicht es der Sprache, «einen unendlichen Gebrauch» von «endlichen Mitteln» zu machen.“[42] Sie ist das primäre Mittel der Kontaktaufnahme und des Informations- und Meinungsaustauschs unter Menschen von Kindesbeinen an. Doch auch alle auf differenzierte Kooperation sich gründenden großen gesellschaftlichen Funktionsbereiche wie Wirtschaft, Verwaltung, Politik und Wissenschaft sind auf die sprachliche Verständigung der Beteiligten elementar angewiesen.

Dem einzelnen Menschen kann die sprachliche Verarbeitung von Sinneseindrücken dabei helfen, Erlebtes auch jenseits der aktuellen Wahrnehmung festzuhalten wie auch eigene Phantasien aufzubewahren: „Ohne Erzählung – eine sprachliche Form, die Einheiten fixiert und Zusammenhänge schafft – zerfällt das Erinnerbare in isolierte Fetzen eines Gedächtnisses, dessen Zuverlässigkeit schnell dahinschwindet. […] Und wenn das geistig Geschaute nicht wieder versinken soll, braucht es die ‚Bergung‘ in die sprachlichen Formen des Begriffs, der Metapher, des Satzes, des Gefüges von Sätzen.“[43] Dazu dienen neben mündlicher Aufbereitung und Weitergabe auch die verschiedenen schriftsprachlichen Äußerungsformen, seien es z. B. biographische Aufzeichnungen, Gebrauchsanweisungen, wissenschaftliche oder poetische Texte.

Für das Hineinwachsen des Individuums in eine mit seinem sozialen Umfeld verbundene Kultur, seine Enkulturation, sind auch bestimmte allgemein verbreitete und festgeprägte Texte maßgeblich, die teils auch aufgesagt oder gesungen werden, wie etwa Sprichwörter, Lieder, Gedichte, Glaubensformeln und Gebete. Sprache ist demnach verknüpft mit der jeweiligen Lebenswelt, in der sie gesprochen wird.[44]

Kultur- und Geschichtsfähigkeit
Neben Sprache und Hören zählen die aus der Sehfähigkeit hervorgehenden Bilder zu den wichtigsten Einflussfaktoren, die die Weltwahrnehmung von Menschen bestimmen. Dabei stehen die über die Augen aufgenommenen „äußeren“ Bilder in einem Verhältnis wechselseitiger Einwirkung mit den vom Gehirn erzeugten „inneren“ Bildern. Allerdings verfügen Menschen selbst über die mit den Augen wahrgenommenen Bilder (und die daraus erzeugten inneren Bilder) nur eingeschränkt. „Wo der Blick verweilt, was er ausgrenzt, was Menschen in ihr Gedächtnis aufnehmen, sodass sie es erinnern können, ist nur zum Teil von ihrem Bewusstsein abhängig. […] Menschen sind ihren inneren Bildern ausgeliefert, auch wenn sie immer wieder versuchen, Kontrolle über sie zu gewinnen. Diese Bilder fluktuieren und verändern sich im Laufe des menschlichen Lebens. Einst wichtige Bilder verlieren an Bedeutung und werden durch neue ersetzt. Doch allen Bildern ist gemeinsam, dass Menschen sich in ihnen erfahren und sich mit ihrer Hilfe ihrer selbst vergewissern.“[45]

Gerade der im Zeitalter des Fernsehens und der diversen Bildspeichermedien kolossal angewachsene menschengemachte Teil der Bilderwelt, in der wir leben, ist durch diese besonderen kulturellen Zusammenhänge stark geprägt. In ihnen formt sich unser Weltbild und die Sicht, die wir Menschen zu Grundfragen unseres Daseins entwickeln, etwa zur Liebe oder zum Tod. So ist die Deutung der eng mit dem Geschlechtstrieb verbundenen Liebe abhängig von den Mythen und rhetorischen Formen einer Gesellschaft; und sie wird in unterschiedlicher Weise sozial kontrolliert. „Das Wesen der Liebe tritt dadurch in Erscheinung, dass man von ihr erzählt. Wie von ihr gesprochen wird, bestimmt die Art und Weise, wie sie erlebt wird. Wie die Liebe ist das Sprechen über die Liebe unendlich […]; es sucht unaufhörlich nach ihrem Geheimnis, ohne es erfassen oder von ihm ablassen zu können, und verführt durch seine Versprechungen, ohne Erfüllung sichern zu können; es verweist auf eine Leere, der es sich zugleich verdankt.“[46]

Kulturspezifisch sind auch die unterschiedlichen Formen der Wahrnehmung und des Umgangs mit dem Tod, der den Lebenden einerseits als schmerzliche Verlusterfahrung begegnet, andererseits als jene beunruhigende Leerstelle, die sich aller Lebenserfahrung entzieht. Mit den verschiedensten Riten, Mythen und Bildgestaltungen suchen die Menschen von jeher das Phänomen des Todes zu bewältigen und zu ertragen. Und doch: „So viele Bilder und Metaphern die Einbildungskraft auch entwirft, um mit dieser Leerstelle umzugehen, es gelingt ihr nur unzulänglich.“[47]

Geburt und Tod begrenzen die lebensweltliche Zeitspanne des Individuums. Menschliches Zeiterleben gründet sich zunächst auf die Erfahrung, dass etwas eine Weile dauert, das eine (zu) kurz, das andere (zu) lang – bis hin zur Langeweile. Es nimmt Gestalt an beispielsweise in den verschiedenen Lebensaltern von der Kindheit bis zum Greisenalter und bekommt individuellen Zuschnitt durch besondere Ereignisse und Erlebnisse wie etwa Schulbeginn, erste Verliebtheit, Berufseinstieg oder Partnerverlust. „Da keiner allein lebt, ist jeder in Geschichten verwickelt: die Geschichten des Volkes in Krieg und Frieden, in Wohlstand und Armut, die Geschichten der Familie, die Geschichten von Verwandten, Freunden und Feinden. Manche von diesen Geschichten kommen von weit her, verästeln sich endlos. Wir tragen ihre Gewichte im Guten wie im Bösen mit uns herum, werden von ihnen in bestimmte Richtungen gelenkt und lenken sie selbst so oder so weiter, bis ‚unsere‘ Zeit vorbei ist und die Zeit anderer Generationen kommt.“[48]

Alles menschliche Handeln in der Gegenwart findet zwischen einer feststehenden Vergangenheit und einer teilweise gestaltbaren Zukunft statt. Das im mitmenschlichen Umgang und durch entsprechende Anregungen erworbene Einfühlungs- und Vorstellungsvermögen eröffnet Möglichkeiten, sich in Vergangenes näherungsweise hineinzuversetzen und plausible Erwartungen an die Zukunft zu entwickeln. Die menschliche Fähigkeit, zu nützlichen Einsichten für die Alltagsbewältigung wie für die Zukunftsgestaltung zu gelangen ist allerdings durch mancherlei hinderliche Einflüsse gefährdet: durch Vergessen und Ausblenden, einseitige Betrachtungsweisen und voreilige Verallgemeinerungen, durch Versinken im Detail oder ungeordnete Informationsüberflutung, durch interessengeleitete Verschleierung oder die fatale Unterschätzung des Nichtwissens im Verhältnis zum Wissen: „So gesehen ist die Wahrheit nur im dauernden Kampf gegen die je neu wachsende Macht des Scheins zu erringen; ist das, was wir von ihr erfassen, immer nur Stückwerk, das außerdem gewissermaßen von selbst zerfällt, wenn man es nicht permanent frisch hält. Diese skeptische Erkenntnis ist jedoch, wie Sokrates erfasste, nicht das Ende, sondern der Anfang aller wahren Erkenntniskultur, im Leben wie in der Wissenschaft.“[49]

Menschheitsfragen
→ Hauptartikel: Welträtsel und Philosophische Anthropologie
In mancher Hinsicht bleibt sich der Mensch auch bei intensiver Selbstprüfung und vielseitiger wissenschaftlicher Erforschung bislang ein Rätsel. Zu den ungelösten bzw. stark umstrittenen Fragen gehören das Phänomen und die Bedingungen des menschlichen Geistes – speziell das Verhältnis von Körper und Geist –, das Problem der Willensfreiheit, die künftige Rolle von Gentechnik und künstlicher Intelligenz in der Menschheitsentwicklung, der Umgang mit anthropogenen Veränderungen der natürlichen Umwelt sowie die Frage nach dem Sinn des menschlichen Lebens.

Körper und Geist – untrennbar verbunden?
→ Hauptartikel: Philosophie des Geistes
Ob der menschliche Geist auch unabhängig vom individuellen Körper besteht oder bestehen kann, ist die ursprüngliche Grundfrage des Leib-Seele-Problems, an der sich seit Platon und Aristoteles die Geister scheiden. Nicht nur in der Philosophie, sondern auch z. B. in der psychosomatischen Medizin und in der Religion spielt diese Frage eine wichtige Rolle. Während Platon im Einklang mit seiner Ideenlehre das Geistige vom Leiblichen zuletzt dualistisch scheidet (die neuzeitlich-klassische Variante dazu ist Descartes’ Formel: Cogito ergo sum), vertritt Aristoteles die Einheit von Körper und Seele des Menschen, die unabhängig voneinander nicht existieren könnten.[50]

Wie Aristoteles leiten auch die beiden Vordenker der philosophischen Anthropologie, Max Scheler und Helmuth Plessner, die besondere Qualität mentaler Prozesse beim Menschen vom Vergleich mit Pflanzen und Tieren ab. Im Gegensatz zu den Pflanzen seien Tiere und Menschen nicht ortsgebunden, sondern können sich im Raum bewegen. Nur der Mensch aber könne auch zum eigenen Körper mental eine distanzierte, reflektierende Position einnehmen: Denn er habe erstens einen Körper, sei zweitens ein Körper mit Seele und Innenleben und könne das drittens von einem außerhalb seiner selbst liegenden „nicht realen“ Blickpunkt aus wahrnehmen.[51] Diese Position wird allerdings von anderen Philosophen wie z. B. Charles Taylor abgelehnt, die darin lediglich eine Selbstbeschreibung des besonderen Menschenbilds der westlichen Zivilisation seit dem Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts sehen.[52]

Wissenschaftler und Philosophen sind sich heute weitgehend einig, dass Geist nicht unabhängig vom Physischen existieren kann, sondern dass er im Laufe der Evolution bei zunehmender Komplexität der biochemischen Strukturen als Eigenschaft hervortrat. Der derzeit herrschende physikalistische Standpunkt geht dabei von einer „besonderen Eigenschaft“ neuronaler Netze aus, die irgendwann als gänzlich neues (emergentes), aber körperabhängiges (supervenientes) Phänomen entstand, während panpsychistische Kritiker eine physische und eine psychische Seite für fundamentale, gegenseitig abhängige Eigenschaften jegliche Materie halten, die gemeinsam komplexer wurden.[53]

Willensfreiheit oder Determiniertheit?
→ Hauptartikel: Freier Wille
Aufgrund seiner „Exzentrizität“ folgt der Mensch – anders als Tiere im Allgemeinen sonst – nicht allein dem instinktiven Lebensdrang, sondern kann sich dazu variabel verhalten, kann selbst gesetzten Zielen zustreben und hat Steuerungsmöglichkeiten in seinem Leben.[54] Zwar gibt es ein weites Feld alltäglicher Verrichtungen, die in den gewohnten Bahnen gleichsam automatisch ablaufen und wenig Aufmerksamkeit erfordern. Daneben sind aber situations- und gelegenheitsbedingte Entscheidungen zu treffen, die auf kurze, mittlere oder lange Sicht bestimmte Weichenstellungen bedeuten. In solchen Entscheidungen und den daraus folgenden Handlungen (oder auch in entsprechenden Unterlassungen) ist das Potential menschlicher Willensfreiheit als Komponente enthalten. Dieses Potential kann sich äußern in Augenblickshandlungen ohne weiterreichende Bedeutung, in einer vorsätzlichen, häufiger wiederkehrenden Verhaltensweise oder auch in einem dauerhaften Gestaltungsprogramm für diesen oder jenen Lebensbereich.[55]

Einige Deterministen (unter ihnen Physiker, Psychologen und Hirnforscher) bestreiten die Existenz eines freien Willens. Sie gehen davon aus, dass individuelles Handeln stets das Ergebnis einer mehr oder minder ausgedehnten Kette von Wirkungsursachen ist, die menschliches Bewusstsein in diese oder jene Richtung steuern. Der individuelle Entscheidungsprozess sei nur scheinhaft; der Ausgang stehe im Vorhinein fest; von einem freien Willen könne keine Rede sein. Andere kritisieren diese Auffassung, da sie auf der Vorstellung eines unbedingten freien Willens basiere, die begrifflich nicht stimmig sei. Sie setzen einen Wirkungsursachen einbeziehenden bedingten freien Willen entgegen.

In der gesellschaftlichen Praxis spricht vieles dafür, am Konzept der freien Willensentscheidungen mit Bedacht festzuhalten. Nur damit lässt sich beispielsweise in der Rechtsprechung die Frage individueller Schuld und Unschuld überhaupt sinnvoll stellen. Ohne ein solches Freiheitskonzept entfiele aber auch die Erwartung, „dass es eine echte Zukunft gibt, die nicht nur die Verlängerung des Gewesenen ist.“[56]

Vom Geschöpf zum Selbsterzeugnis?
→ Hauptartikel: Neuroethik und Digitale Revolution
Welche Zukunft die Menschheit vor sich hat, ist neuerdings auch eine Frage des Umgangs mit den Entwicklungen in der Biotechnologie und Bioethik. War die genetische Ausstattung des einzelnen Menschen im bisherigen Verlauf der Menschheitsgeschichte eine unveränderliche, natürliche Vorgabe, die seinen Lebenslauf und sein Schicksal mitbestimmte, so werden gegenwärtig auf dem Wege der Genomanalyse, des Klonens und der Erprobung von Eingriffen in die Keimbahn biotechnologisch neue Horizonte eröffnet. Sie werden je nach Anwendungsbereich und persönlichem Standort als Verheißung begrüßt oder als Bedrohung gefürchtet.[57] So stehen der Aussicht auf Vorbeugung und Heilung von Krankheiten andere Perspektiven gegenüber, die Möglichkeiten „eugenischer Selektion und Züchtung sowie die Reduktion des Menschen auf einen Träger genetischer Informationen und auf ein Objekt ökonomischer Interessen“ aufzeigen.[58]

Nicht zuletzt auf das menschliche Gehirn als Hervorbringungsort von Geist und Intellekt sowie als emotionales Steuerungszentrum sind die Optimierungsbemühungen im Überschneidungsbereich von Neurowissenschaften und Biotechnologie gerichtet. Neben den herkömmlichen und neueren psychoaktiven Substanzen, Psychopharmaka und Stimulanzien zur Beeinflussung der Hirntätigkeit spielen auch Neuroimplantate zunehmend eine Rolle in der Diskussion um den Ausgleich von Hirnfehlfunktionen und bei der Planung eines perfektionierten kognitiven Leistungsvermögens. Die einschlägige Debatte befasst sich bereits mit Implantaten zur optimalen Anpassung an moderne Arbeitsprozesse. „Solche Überlegungen zum Neuroenhancement sind schon deshalb nahe liegend, weil ein entsprechendes Vorgehen der künstlichen Optimierung der Leistungsfähigkeit des menschlichen Körpers (etwa im Leistungssport) analog ist. Hier würde es sich mithin nur um eine Erweiterung einer gängigen Praxis handeln.“[59] Mag man reprogenetischen und computertechnischen Visionen von einem „neuen Menschen“ – eine sehr alte Vorstellung – auch skeptisch begegnen, ist andererseits die Gewöhnung an neurochirurgische Eingriffe und elektronische Implantate wohl zu erwarten, denn: „Dass wir mit dem Bestehenden, auch mit uns unzufrieden sind, ist eine anthropologische Konstante.“[60]

Während einerseits Forschungen begonnen haben, die aus Menschen als kulturell geprägten Naturgeschöpfen mehr oder weniger biologisch programmierte Kreaturen machen könnten, gibt es im Zuge der Digitalen Revolution vielfältige Ansätze zur Entwicklung außermenschlicher bzw. künstlicher Intelligenz. Dabei handelt es sich – über das Vermögen etwa von Schachcomputern zur Verarbeitung großer Datenmengen und zum logischen Kalkül hinaus – um die Automatisierung intelligenten Verhaltens in diversen Anwendungsbereichen sowie um die diesbezügliche Entwicklung und Optimierung von Robotern. Über Fortgang und Ausgang solcher Vorhaben kann einstweilen nur spekuliert werden: „Die biotechnologische Forschung lebt von den überlieferten Träumen der Menschheit und arbeitet an ihrer Realisierung. In einer entwicklungsoffenen Zukunft könnte an der Schnittstelle von natürlicher Künstlichkeit technologisch optimierter menschlicher Organismen und künstlicher Natürlichkeit organisch-technologischer Systeme aus der Analogie von Mensch und Maschine eine Gleichung werden.“[61]

Von der Umweltgestaltung zur Umweltzerstörung?
Siehe auch: Anthropozän und Nachhaltigkeit
Spätestens seit der Neolithischen Revolution hat der Mensch begonnen, die vorgefundene natürliche Umwelt durch den Übergang zu Sesshaftigkeit und Agrikultur sowie mit der Schaffung städtischer Lebensräume markant zu verändern. Als Folgen der Industriellen Revolution und einer rasant wachsenden Weltbevölkerung werden die menschlichen Eingriffe in die naturgegebene Ordnung immer mehr zu einem ökologischen Problem, das etwa im Zusammenhang mit der globalen Erwärmung die natürlichen Lebensgrundlagen des heutigen Menschen überhaupt in Frage stellt. Diese Herausforderung ist umso ernster, weil Luft und Atmosphäre wie die Weltmeere als Allgemeingut (Allmende) traditionell jedermanns freier Nutzung unterliegen, die Verzichtsleistung Einzelner zu ihrer Schonung aber kaum ins Gewicht fällt: die Tragik der Allmende.[62] Ob der angelaufene Umsteuerungsprozess bei der Nutzung fossiler Energieträger im Sinne des Klimaschutzes das Problem ausreichend lindern wird, könnte auch davon abhängen, welche menschlichen Potentiale in dieser Frage überwiegen: der individuelle Hang zu optimistischer, illusionsbehafteter Selbsteinschätzung und Zukunftserwartung oder ein aufklärerisches Denken, das den „Schatten der Zukunft“ zu einem grundlegenden Maßstab für das Handeln in der Gegenwart macht.[63]

Einem teils bedrohlich wahrgenommenen Wandel ist auch die kulturelle Umwelt vieler Menschen im Zuge der Globalisierung ausgesetzt, die von weltweiter wirtschaftlicher und medialer Vernetzung angetrieben, Veränderungen gesellschaftskultureller Art sowie neue Lebensformen und Lebenswelten hervorbringt. Werden damit einerseits Hoffnungen auf eine Weltgesellschaft mit universeller demokratischer Kultur gespeist, so steht für andere die Erwartung von Identitätsverlust im Vordergrund und damit verbunden das Beharren auf der Notwendigkeit kultureller Differenz.

Hat das menschliche Leben einen Sinn?
→ Hauptartikel: Sinn des Lebens
Die Frage nach dem Sinn aufzuwerfen, ist dem Menschen wiederum nur als einem Wesen möglich, das nicht in den Lebensvollzügen aufgeht, wie es bei anderen Lebewesen der Fall ist, sondern Abstand zum eigenen Tun herstellen und zu sich selbst eine beobachtende Haltung einnehmen kann. Was und wozu der Mensch sei, gehört darum zu den Grundfragen von Religion und Philosophie.[64] Die Reflexion der Sinnfrage kann auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen ansetzen: an einzelnen Lebenssituationen, am Sinn eines bestimmten individuellen Lebens im Ganzen und am Dasein von Menschen überhaupt. Einer allgemeingültigen Beantwortung – etwa als Ergebnis wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen – entzieht sich eine solche Frage jedoch: „Diese Suche ist Sache jedes Einzelnen, meistens in dem Maß, wie er durch seine Veranlagung und seine Geschichte zu ihr befähigt und auch gedrängt ist. Wegen der großen Verschiedenheit der Lebensschicksale und wegen der wesentlich persönlichen und praktischen Natur der Sinn-Erfassung ist hier eine allgemeine anthropologische Wissenschaft und Reflexion überfordert; sie kann dem Einzelnen sein persönliches Suchen, Irren und Finden nicht abnehmen, indem sie ihm verlässliche theoretische Auskünfte und praktische Anweisungen lieferte.“[65]

Auch für den einzelnen Menschen stellt sich aber die Sinnfrage weder ständig noch in der Weise, dass sie ein für alle Mal zu beantworten ist, sondern hauptsächlich in Entscheidungssituationen, in denen eine sinnträchtige Wahl getroffen sein will. Günstig dafür, dass die Frage nach dem Sinn des Lebens vom Einzelnen positiv beantwortet werden kann, sind Selbstakzeptanz und die Annahme der eigenen Lebenssituation wie auch eine mit dem Tod sich positiv abfindende Haltung. „Wer ein erfülltes Leben hat, ist auch bereit zu gehen, und diejenigen kleben am meisten am Überleben, die am wenigsten gelebt haben. Wer nicht weiß, wofür es sich wirklich zu leben lohnt, verdrängt den Tod; und wer etwas kennt, das es wert ist, dass man notfalls dafür das Leben riskiert, weiß auch, wofür es sich lohnt zu leben.“[66]
Menschwerdung mit Werkzeugen
→ Hauptartikel: Stammesgeschichte des Menschen, Hominisation und Ausbreitung des Menschen

Steinwerkzeug (Geröllgerät) vom Oldowan-Typ
Am Ende eines über ca. 15 Millionen Jahre sich erstreckenden Entwicklungsprozesses der Hominiden entstand vor etwa zwei Millionen Jahren in Ostafrika der als Urmensch anzusehende Homo habilis / Homo rudolfensis und in der Folge der als Erster nach Art des anatomisch modernen Menschen laufende Homo erectus, der auch bereits auf Java nachgewiesen wurde.[3]

Tatsächlich lebten noch vor rund 100.000 Jahren gleichzeitig mehrere Menschenarten auf der Erde.[4] Zerschlagene Knochen diverser Großtierarten in Ostafrika und entsprechend bearbeitete Steine verweisen auf die Epoche der Altsteinzeit. Auch Tiere nutzen zwar vorgefundene Gegenstände als Werkzeuge, um bestimmte Ziele zu erreichen. Im Unterschied zu ihnen aber zeigten sich Frühmenschen in der Lage, Form und Eigenschaften ihrer Werkzeuge zu verändern, um sie noch effektiver einsetzen zu können. „Neue Steinbearbeitungstechniken führten zu schärferen Kanten, und der Einsatz von immer höherwertigeren, flexibel nutzbaren Rohmaterialien wie Knochen, Horn und Holz zu verbesserten Werkzeugen mit größerem Wirkungsspektrum.“[5] Überwiegende Lebensgrundlage waren jedoch Früchte, Wurzeln und Kleingetier. Die Besetzung von Höhlen als Wohnstätten und ihre Verteidigung gegen wilde Tiere fallen mit der Spätphase des Homo erectus zusammen.[6]

Folgenreiche Feuerbeherrschung
Dass der Homo erectus bereits das Feuer beherrschte, gilt als gesichert, da die Feuernutzung in einer südafrikanischen Höhle in Schichten des Acheuléen bereits vor 1,7 Millionen Jahren nachgewiesen ist.[7] Mit der Beherrschung des Feuers konnte Fleisch durch das Räuchern haltbarer gemacht werden. Die Nahrungszubereitung und -verwertung wurde durch Kochen und Braten erweitert bzw. differenziert; auch waren Fleisch und gesammelte Pflanzen nach dem Braten und Kochen für den menschlichen Organismus besser verdaulich. Zudem bot das Feuer Schutz vor Insektenschwärmen und ließ sich bei Treibjagden nützlich verwenden.[8]

Durch die Hitze wurden Bakterien und Parasiten abgetötet; Früchte, Nüsse, Insekten und Aas wurden durch die Feuereinwirkung leichter kau- und verdaubar. Die Bandbreite genießbarer Nahrungsmittel wuchs an. Im Vergleich etwa zu Menschenaffen ließ sich für so zubereitetes Essen bei der Nahrungsaufnahme Zeit sparen und mit kleineren Zähnen und kürzeren Därmen auskommen. „Da lange Därme genauso große Energiefresser sind wie große Gehirne, ist es kaum möglich, beide gleichzeitig zu unterhalten. Weil das Kochen jedoch eine Verkürzung des Verdauungstrakts und damit Energieeinsparungen ermöglichte, bereitete es ganz nebenbei den gewaltigen Gehirnen des Neandertalers und des Homo sapiens den Boden.“[9]

Die Jagd als Entwicklungstreiber
Der archaische Homo sapiens dürfte also seine Überlebenschancen durch eine fortgeschrittene Kontrolle über das Feuer beträchtlich verbessert und die eigene Ausbreitung in kältere Klimazonen ermöglicht haben.[10] Zu den Anfängen einer nachhaltigen Weiterentwicklung menschlicher Kultur und gesellschaftlicher Strukturen kam es durch eine immer weiter fortschreitende Spezialisierung der Jagd. Die Treibjagd setzt eine komplexe Kooperation und sprachliche Koordination zwischen Treibern und Jägern voraus, in die auch der Hund zum Aufspüren der Beute einbezogen wurde. Die Anfänge seiner Domestikation liegen über 30.000 Jahre zurück.[11] Als wohl älteste Maschine der Menschheit wurde die Speerschleuder entwickelt, die Nachbauten zufolge Abwurfgeschwindigkeiten des Speers von über 100 km/h ermöglichte und entsprechende Durchschlagskraft entfaltete.[12]

Das Zerteilen und Haltbarmachen der Beute, das Errichten von Hütten und das Wachen über das Feuer dürften zu ersten Schritten in eine arbeitsteilige Gesellschaft und zu komplexeren Formen kooperativer Arbeit geführt haben, zu einer neuen Qualität sozialer Beziehungen.[13] Mit der am Kopf durchlochten Nähnadel aus Knochen ließen sich Kleidung und Tierfelle als Wärmeschutz für die Behausungen besser vernähen und abdichten.[14] Annähernd gleichzeitig entstanden frühe Formen von Malerei, plastischer Kunst und Musik, letztere zunächst mit einfachen Flöten aus Röhrenknochen verbunden.[15]

Als Folgen ergaben sich eine zunehmende Vorherrschaft des Menschen über die übrige Fauna und eine entsprechende Zunahme der menschlichen Population. Dass kältere Klimazonen erschließbar wurden, begünstigte die Ausbreitung des Menschen von Afrika bis in alle Erdteile.[16] Der Ausbreitungsprozess auf alle Kontinente ging mit einem Massenaussterben zahlreicher Tierarten einher. Von insgesamt 200 Säugetierarten mit über 50 Kilogramm Gewicht war zu Beginn der landwirtschaftlichen Revolution in der Jungsteinzeit nur noch etwa die Hälfte übrig.[17]

Sesshaftigkeit und „neolithische Revolution“

Fruchtbarer Halbmond um 7500 v. Chr.
Die letzte Eiszeit war überall auf der Erde mit außerordentlich tiefgreifenden Änderungen der Lebensbedingungen verbunden, die schwierige Anpassungsleistungen erforderten. Zum Ende der Eiszeit bewirkte der dramatische Anstieg des Meeresspiegels – in der Ostsee um 25 Meter – unter anderem einen neuen Küstenverlauf zwischen Südostasien und Australien. In Mitteleuropa bestimmten zunehmend Birken-, Kiefern- und Mischwälder das Landschaftsbild. So konzentrierte sich die nacheiszeitliche Besiedlung hier mit spezialisierten Jäger-, Fischer- und Sammlergemeinschaften des Mesolithikums an Flüssen, Seen und Meeresküsten.[18]

Anfänge ortsgebundener Landwirtschaft
Im östlichen Mittelmeerraum führte das milde Klima des Alleröd-Interstadials (ca. 12. bis 11. vorchristliches Jahrtausend) vorübergehend zu einer großen Artenvielfalt und -dichte, die es den Menschen ermöglichte, ihre Schweifgebiete deutlich zu reduzieren und länger an einem Ort zu wohnen. Vor allem das ganzjährig vorhandene Nahrungsangebot an Gazellen und den Wildformen von Weizen und Gerste ermöglichte bereits eine weitgehende Sesshaftigkeit vor der Erfindung des systematischen Pflanzenanbaus. Spätestens um 11.000 v. Chr. erkannten die Menschen der Levante den Vorteil schnell wachsender Wildgetreide, um saisonale Engpässe durch die Übernutzung der Nahrungsressourcen im Umkreis der Siedlungen zu kompensieren. Dennoch blieben die Menschen in erster Linie Jäger und Sammler, da der Pflanzenbau mehr Zeit und Arbeitsaufwand erforderte. Die sesshaftere Lebensweise führte allerdings zu einem verstärkten Kulturwandel, der sich etwa in deutlich größeren Besitztümern, veränderten Sozialstrukturen und Wertvorstellungen zeigte. Als der drastische Kälteeinbruch der jüngeren Dryaszeit um die Mitte des 11. Jahrtausends zu einer rapiden Verringerung der Nahrungsressourcen führte, waren die Menschen nicht mehr bereit oder in der Lage, ihre Sesshaftigkeit aufzugeben und zum Wildbeutertum zurückzukehren. Sie waren nunmehr gezwungen, die häufigen saisonalen Nahrungsengpässe durch die Intensivierung der produzierenden Wirtschaftsweise zu überbrücken.[19][20] Von diesem Zeitpunkt an waren organisierte Landwirtschaft und die Anlage ortsfester Siedlungen und Dörfer nicht mehr voneinander zu trennen.[21]

Durch Kultivierung veränderte Nutzpflanzen sind ab 9500 v. Chr. nachgewiesen. Dies gilt als frühester Beginn der Jungsteinzeit. Im Zuge der Klimaveränderungen wurden sicherlich auch die Vorteile der Haltung und Zähmung verschiedener Wildtiere erkannt, sodass es um 8500 bis 8000 v. Chr. schließlich ebenfalls im fruchtbaren Halbmond zur Domestizierung von Schafen, Ziegen und Rindern kam. Die Nutztierhaltung war ursprünglich eine reine Fernweidewirtschaft, aus denen die hirtennomadischen Kulturen hervorgingen.

Agrargesellschaften entstanden unabhängig voneinander zuerst im fruchtbaren Halbmond als auch später in Südostasien und in den südamerikanischen Anden.[22] Während im Vorderen Orient der Anbau von Bodenfrüchten über der Erde zum Zuge kam (neben Weizen und Gerste auch Erbsen, Oliven, Weinbau sowie Obstbäume), wurde Südostasien zum ersten Zentrum des Anbaus von Knollenfrüchten unter der Erde. In China kamen bald darauf mit Reisanbau und Knollenfrüchten beide Anbauformen zusammen.[23] Wo man über entsprechende Nutztiere verfügte (nicht also in Nord- und Südamerika vor Ankunft der Spanier), steigerte die Erfindung des Pflügens etwa um 6500 v. Chr. den landwirtschaftlichen Ertrag so bedeutsam, dass dafür der Begriff der „zweiten agrarkulturellen Revolution“ eingeführt wurde.[24] Zur Vorratshaltung und zum Schutz von Nahrungsmitteln gegen Kleintiere entwickelte sich im Zusammenhang mit der neolithischen Wirtschaftsweise im Vorderen Orient und China die Gefäßkeramik seit etwa 7.000 v. Chr.; zu zeremoniellen Zwecken gab es sie schon früher.

Vom Wildbeuter- zum Bauerndasein
Der geochronologische Begriff des Anthropozän, der das Zeitalter der menschlichen Beeinflussung des Planeten bezeichnet und heute oft auf den Klimawandel bezogen wird, kann mit einer gewissen Berechtigung bereits auf diese jungsteinzeitliche Periode angewendet werden, griff der Mensch doch durch Be- und Entwässerung, Auswahl von Saaten und Zuchttieren sowie Feldbau in biologische Prozesse ein, wenn auch zunächst nur punktuell und lokal.[25]

Wenn für die Gesamtheit der mit Sesshaftigkeit und Domestikation von Pflanzen und Tieren einhergehenden veränderten Lebensweisen und ihrer Ausbreitung von „neolithischer Revolution“ die Rede ist, bleibt also zu bedenken, dass es dabei nicht um einen kurzfristig weltweit durchschlagenden Wandel handelte. Vielmehr war es eine jahrtausendelang andauernde fundamentale Entwicklung, die von der Parallelexistenz nomadisierender Stämme und Völker begleitet war und blieb.[26] Während die Bewohner Alt-Amerikas in dafür geeigneten Regionen wie auf der Hochebene Mexikos oder in den Anden den Übergang zu agrarischer Produktion mit Kartoffeln und Mais vollzogen, blieben die Aborigines in Australien, die Bewohner der Arktis und Subarktis sowie viele Völker der Tropen bis zur neuzeitlichen europäischen Besiedlung jagende und sammelnde Nomaden.[27]

Eine klare Grenze zwischen Wildbeutertum auf der einen Seite und Sesshaftigkeit in Verbindung mit Landwirtschaft auf der anderen Seite zu ziehen, sei nicht immer leicht, heißt es bei Hermann Parzinger, denn es existierten auch Mischformen. In den tropischen Gebieten von Papua-Neuguinea und Amazonien beispielsweise gab es Wandergartenbauern, also mobile Jäger und Sammler, die essbare Pflanzen systematisch ernteten und zum Teil auch umpflanzten.[28]

Yuval Noah Harari sieht in der landwirtschaftliche Revolution keine Lebenserleichterung für die Menschen. Die Jäger und Sammler hätten sich gesünder ernährt und weniger Hunger gelitten, weniger gearbeitet und seien interessanteren, weniger monotonen Tätigkeiten nachgegangen.

„Wenn Wildbeuter von einer rivalisierenden Gruppe bedrängt wurden, konnten sie ausweichen. Das war zwar schwierig und gefährlich, doch es war möglich. Wenn dagegen ein Bauerndorf von einem stärkeren Feind bedroht wurde, konnten die Bewohner nicht ausweichen, ohne ihre Felder, Häuser und Schuppen zurückzulassen und den Hungertod zu riskieren. Daher blieben die Bauern und kämpften bis zum bitteren Ende.“

Demnach geht die Wissenschaft heute davon aus, dass der unattraktive Feldbau notgedrungen intensiviert werden musste, um die bereits etablierte sesshafte Lebensweise weiter fortführen zu können. Im Laufe der Zeit ermöglichte zunächst die immer gezieltere Auswahl von Saatgut und dann der technische Fortschritt, immer mehr Nahrungsenergie pro Fläche zu erzeugen. Dies wiederum führte zu einer Vermehrung der Menschen in vorher nie gekanntem Ausmaß.[29]

Hochkulturen und Schriftentwicklung

Keilschrift
Der Übergang zur Sesshaftigkeit ging nicht ohne Weiteres mit der Bildung von Städten oder mit staatlicher Organisation einher. In den ersten Jahrtausenden blieb es bei unzähligen kleinen und relativ autonomen dörflichen Siedlungen, die keiner zentralen Macht unterworfen waren. Doch mit dem einsetzenden rapiden Bevölkerungswachstum verband sich eine regional unterschiedlich ausgeprägte Dynamik zur Entstehung komplexer Gesellschaften mit befestigten Zentralorten, ersten Gemeinschaftsinstitutionen, zunehmender Arbeitsteilung und Spezialisierung sowie technischen Innovationen und organisiertem Fernhandel. In Mesopotamien führte die Gründung erster Dörfer, so Parzinger, direkt auf den Weg zu einer urbanen Entwicklung. Im Übergangszeitraum vom 7. zum 6. Jahrtausend v. Chr. begann man mit künstlicher Bewässerung zur Steigerung der landwirtschaftlichen Erträge.

Während des späten 4. und 3. Jahrtausends eröffneten die Erfindung von Rad und Wagen sowie die Abrichtung und Nutzung von Pferden neue Möglichkeiten des Gütertransports und der beschleunigten Überwindung großer Entfernungen; der Einsatz von Zugtieren und Hakenpflug half wiederum, die landwirtschaftlichen Erträge zu steigern.[30] Erste staatliche Gebilde entstanden im 4. Jahrtausend v. Chr. in Mesopotamien, in Ägypten am Nil und an der südamerikanischen Pazifikküste.[31] Die seit dem 3. Jahrtausend v. Chr. vom Nahen Osten einsetzende Verbreitung der Bronze als Werkstoff führte zur Entwicklung ausgedehnter Fernhandelsnetze, da das zur Legierung des Kupfers erforderliche Zinn aus entfernten Regionen wie Afghanistan importiert werden musste.

Schriftliche Quellen zur Menschheitsgeschichte gibt es erst von den Hochkulturen des Alten Vorderen Orients in Mesopotamien (Sumer) und Ägypten (etwa ab 3100 v. Chr.), am Indus (Indus-Kultur ab ca. 2600 v. Chr.), am Gelben Fluss (ab 1523 v. Chr.). Die sumerische Schrift enthielt zum einen Zahlenzeichen zum Beispiel für 1, 6, 60 und 600 – ein auf der Zahl 6 basierendes Sexagesimalsystem, das den 24 Stunden eines Tages oder den 360 Grad eines Kreises zugrunde liegt. Die andere Gruppe sumerischer Zeichen stellte Menschen, Tiere, Waren und dergleichen mehr dar. Mit der Fixierung solcher Zeichen auf Tontafeln ließen sich große Datenmengen jenseits jedes Erinnerungsvermögens menschlicher Gehirne festhalten.[32] Von weit ausstrahlender und nachhaltiger Bedeutung waren insbesondere die ältesten Hochkulturen im Bereich des fruchtbaren Halbmonds mit ihren Merkmalen: Städte, Staatlichkeit und Bürokratie; Priestertum und Theokratie; Anfänge von Wissenschaft und Technik; Kalender und Zeiteinteilung; Geldwirtschaft und komplexe Handelsbeziehungen; Kriegsführung und Reichsbildung. Später und davon unabhängig entwickelten sich ab 1000 v. Chr. die Hochkulturen der Maya, Azteken und Inka in Amerika.


Bronzeschmelzofen in Kato Zakros (Kreta) um 1600 v. Chr. Er gilt als der älteste erhaltene Metallschmelzofen. Durch Kanäle wurde die Luftzufuhr zum Ofen gesteuert, in dem Erze und Holzkohle aufgestapelt waren. Die flüssige Bronze konnte durch ein Ausgussloch abfließen.
Auch in Europa entstanden in der Bronzezeit differenzierte Sozialstrukturen, komplexe Herrschaftsgebilde und größere Orte mit starken Befestigungsanlagen, von denen aus die Fernhandelsrouten durch Kleinkönige beherrscht wurden. Grabanlagen wie das Fürstengrab von Leubingen zeugen vom Reichtum und Status der Oberschichten der Bronzezeit, die den Handel kontrollierten. Doch brach um 1250 v. Chr. der Fernhandel im mediterranen Bereich infolge kriegerischer Auseinandersetzungen teilweise zusammen; mehrere Hochkulturen wie die Mykenische Kultur, das Hethiterreich, die Handelsmacht Ugarit und das Königreich Alašija auf Zypern gingen unter.[33] In Europa wurde Zinn knapp, auch hier kam es zu Handelskriegen.[34]

Mit der durch den Zinnmangel bedingten Verbreitung des Werkstoffes Eisen, das um 1500 v. Chr. bereits von den Hethitern, um 1300 v. Chr. in Indien, nach 1000 v. Chr. in Griechenland und seit etwa 800 v. Chr. in Mitteleuropa verwendet wurde, wandelten sich die Siedlungs- und Herrschaftsstrukturen vielfach im Sinne einer stärkeren Egalisierung. Viele Orte, an denen oberflächennahes Eisen existierte, gewannen gegenüber den bronzezeitlichen Herrschaftssitzen an Bedeutung. Bei der Eisenverhüttung mittels Holzkohle war kein kompliziertes Legierungsverfahren notwendig, so dass in vielen Siedlungen jeder Mann mit Eisenwerkzeugen ausgestattet werden und geschmiedete Eisenwaffen tragen konnte – eine Grundlage der Bildung lokaler Gefolgschaften junger Männer, die sich zu kriegerischen Zwecken durch eine Art Treueverhältnis an einen Anführer banden. In China, wo Eisen seit ca. 550 v. Chr. bei wesentlich höheren Temperaturen im Hochofen verhüttet und gegossen werden konnte, trat dieser Dezentralisierungseffekt nicht ein. Im subsaharischen Afrika wurde die Eisengewinnung wohl unabhängig von vorderasiatischen Einflüssen seit etwa 500 v. Chr. in der Tschadregion praktiziert.

Ausbildung von Weltanschauungen und Religionen
Aus den frühen Hochkulturen gingen Religionen von nachhaltiger Bedeutung hervor: der Zoroastrismus aus Persien, Hinduismus und Buddhismus aus Indien, Judentum, Christentum und Islam aus dem Nahen Osten.[35] Als eine Ära der Weichenstellungen im eurasischen Raum wird die Zeit um 500 v. Chr. betrachtet, für die Karl Jaspers den Begriff „Achsenzeit“ geprägt hat. In China kam es nach dem jahrhundertelangen Zerfall des Reiches zu einer religiös-weltanschaulichen Krise, in der Konfuzius neue Orientierung bot; in Indien verbreiteten sich die Lehren Buddhas; im Iran hatte Zarathustra seinen Wirkungskreis mit der Lehre von Licht und Finsternis bzw. Gut und Böse, ein Dualismus, der nach der Rückkehr der Juden nach Jerusalem sowohl ihre religiösen Vorstellungen mitbestimmte als auch nachmals in spezifischen Abwandlungen die von Christen und Muslimen. Unter den Griechen vor allem in Kleinasien hingegen wurde etwa zeitgleich mit dem Übergang zur Geldwirtschaft von den ionischen Naturphilosophen eine „säkularisierte und individualisierte Wendung“ vollzogen, mit der die Grundlagen für die westliche Philosophie und Naturwissenschaft gelegt wurden.[36]

Griechische Prägungen

Die Akropolis von Athen
Als „logische Konsequenz aus der Expansion des zivilisatorischen Prinzips selbst“[37] entstanden an den Rändern des vorderasiatischen Hochkulturzentrums – in der Ägäis, in Kleinasien und Griechenland – weitere Kulturzentren mit eigenen spezifischen Merkmalen. Die griechische Antike hinterließ der Menschheit Begriffe und originäre Leitbilder für Demokratie, Politik, Philosophie und Kritik. In ihr wurden Grundlagen für ein rationales Weltbild gelegt, wurden bahnbrechende Impulse für Mathematik, Naturwissenschaften und Technik gesetzt. In Dichtung und Literatur, in bildender Kunst und fürs Theater wurden Werke geschaffen, die wie die Olympischen Spiele bis in die Gegenwart Reiz und Wirkung entfalteten.[38]

Für die damalige mittelöstliche Großmacht Persien blieben die griechischen Poleis und Inseln auch nach der Selbstbehauptung der Griechen in den Perserkriegen nur ein widerspenstiges Ärgernis in Randlage. Als ein „Land des Überflusses“, das den Mittelmeerraum mit dem Herzen Asiens verband, charakterisiert Peter Frankopan das Perserreich. Es habe über ein ausgedehntes Straßennetz verfügt, um das „das ganze Altertum die Perser beneidete.“[39] Wie für alle Griechen hätten auch für Alexander den Großen die großen Verheißungen und lohnenden Gefahren im Osten gelegen, dem folglich logischen Ziel des Alexanderzugs. Während Alexander es sich zur Gewohnheit machte, im Respekt vor den regionalen Bräuchen traditionelle Titel anzunehmen und persische Kleidung zu tragen, legte er umgekehrt die Grundlagen für die Hellenisierung der eroberten Gebiete, die unter anderem im griechischen Sprachgebrauch und in der Ausbreitung der olympischen Götterwelt – laut Herodot bis nach Indien – ihre Wirkung entfaltete.[40]

Das Römische Imperium im Kraftfeld östlicher Nachbarn

Im Römischen Reich wurde das kulturelle Erbe der Griechen als Bildungsgut angeeignet und bewahrt. Wachstum und relative Stabilität der römischen Herrschaft wurden durch ausgreifende Verleihung des Römischen Bürgerrechts an Unterworfene begünstigt, die so nach und nach romanisiert und zu Gleichberechtigten wurden. Eine Zeiten und Räume übergreifende Wirkung entfaltete das Römische Recht.[41]

Mit der römischen Eroberung Ägyptens im Vorfeld des Augustäischen Prinzipats hatte man Zugriff auf die üppigen Getreideernten im Nildelta, wodurch der Getreidepreis fiel und die Staatskassen beträchtlich entlastet wurden. Die damit und mit der Konsolidierung des Römischen Reiches einhergehende Wohlstandsmehrung bildete die Grundlage dafür, dass Augustus mit Blick auf die seinerzeitigen Stadtbildveränderungen in Rom schließlich bilanzieren konnte, er habe eine Stadt aus Ziegelsteinen angetroffen, sie aber in Marmor hinterlassen.[42] Florierende Handelsbeziehungen der Römer reichten im Osten bis Indien; und auch chinesische Seide gelangte bereits nach Rom.[43]

Nachdem unter Trajan, der zeitweise ähnliche Ambitionen wie Alexander der Große entwickelte, das Römische Reich seine größte Ausdehnung erreicht hatte, ging es nach dem Tod dieses Kaisers hauptsächlich um Stabilisierung und Verteidigung des Erreichten. Dabei wurde Persien unter den Sassaniden neuerlich zur östlichen Großmacht. Die Gründung Konstantinopels zu Beginn des 4. Jahrhunderts, das bald zur größten und wichtigsten Metropole im Mittelmeerraum wurde, bedeutete die Schwerpunktverlagerung des römischen Herrschaftszentrums nach Osten, wo einerseits Erträge aus dem Schwarzmeerhandel lockten, andererseits die Verteidigungsvorkehrungen immer dringlicher erschienen.[44]

Klimawandel, Wanderungsströme und Zerfallserscheinungen
Eine Änderung des Erdklimas im 5. Jahrhundert, das sogenannte Pessimum der Völkerwanderungszeit, das in Europa mit einem steigenden Meeresspiegel, an der Nordsee mit Malaria und in asiatischen Steppengebieten mit Dürren und veränderter Vegetation einherging,[45] löste in China eine Hungerkatastrophe aus und veranlasste den Kaiser zur Verlagerung des Herrschersitzes. Unter den sich neu formierenden Steppenvölkern Zentralasiens waren es die Hunnen – andere vor sich hertreibend –, die zeitweise verheerenden Druck sowohl auf das Römische als auch auf das Sassanidenreich ausübten. Beide ansonsten rivalisierenden Mächte fanden dieser Bedrohung gegenüber bei der Errichtung und Unterhaltung einer fast zweihundert Kilometer langen Mauer zusammen, die zwischen Kaspischem und Schwarzem Meer das Eindringen nomadischer Völker über den Kaukasus verhindern sollte. Während der westliche Teil des Römischen Reiches dem Ansturm unterlegen war, blieben die östlichen Provinzen Kleinasien, Syrien und Palästina und Ägypten vorerst verschont.[46]

Als die Hunnen unter ihrem Anführer Attila im 5. Jahrhundert auf den Balkan vordrangen, schien es auch im stark befestigten Konstantinopel ratsam, durch Tributentrichtung an die Hunnen deren weiteres Vordringen in den eigenen Machtbereich abzuwenden. Nach der Niederlage Attilas 451 auf den Katalaunischen Feldern zogen sich die Hunnen zwar nach Osten zurück; auf dem Gebiet des untergegangenen Weströmischen Reiches aber zeigten sich kulturelle Verfallserscheinungen: eine drastisch zurückgehende Alphabetisierung, kaum noch Steinbauten, ein unbedeutender Warenaustausch auf lokalen Märkten statt des aufgegebenen Fernhandels und eine stark rückläufige Eisengewinnung.[47]

Mittelalterliche Konstellationen und Entwicklungen
Für den je nach Abgrenzung bis zu tausendjährigen Zeitraum zwischen dem Niedergang des antiken Römischen Reiches und der die Neuzeit einleitenden Entdeckung und Eroberung Amerikas durch europäische Kolonisten hat sich in der westlichen Historiographie der Begriff Mittelalter etabliert. Auf andere Kontinente und ihre Bewohner ist dieses Periodisierungsschema allerdings nur bedingt sinnvoll anzuwenden. So datieren beispielsweise Geschehnisse in Asien, die wesentlich zur Völkerwanderung und dem Ende der Antike beitrugen, lange vor dem 5. Jahrhundert. Immer mehr Autoren weisen jedoch darauf hin, dass nicht nur in Japan, sondern auch in Indien und Afrika Phänomene einer frühen Feudalisierung zu verzeichnen sind, die starke Ähnlichkeiten mit dem europäischen Mittelalter aufweisen.[48]

Religion und Herrschaft
Die Christenmission verzeichnete gerade im asiatischen Raum den Handelsrouten entlang anhaltend große Erfolge, obwohl Dogmenstreitigkeiten nach dem Ende der Christenverfolgungen die Einheit der Christen im Glauben anhaltend in Frage stellten und schließlich zur Trennung in eine westlich-römische und eine östlich-byzantinische Kirche führten. Städte wie Merw, Gundischapur und auch die Oasenstadt Kaschgar hatten beispielsweise Erzbischöfe lange vor Canterbury. „Selbst im Mittelalter“, schreibt Frankopan, „gab es in Asien vielmehr Christen als in Europa.“[49]


Byzanz und das Kalifat im Frühmittelalter
Im 7. Jahrhundert trat im arabisch-nahöstlichen Raum neben die beiden monotheistischen Religionen der Juden und Christen als dritte der Islam, nachdem dessen Prophet Mohammed gegen anfängliche Widerstände in Mekka zu einer breiten Anhängerschaft gekommen war. Die damaligen Bedingungen waren für die rasche Ausbreitung des Islam günstig: Verfallserscheinungen im Sassanidenreich, eine weitere Schwächung Ostroms und damit korrespondierend die Bereitschaft vieler Juden und Christen, sich mit den in Glaubensfragen nicht allzu fremden Muslimen als Schutz gewährender Vormacht zu arrangieren.[50]

Infolge der islamischen Expansion wurden die wirtschaftlichen Kernlande des Römischen Reiches und Persiens – darunter Ägypten und Mesopotamien – miteinander verbunden in einem Machtgebilde, das im 8. Jahrhundert bereits vom Himalaya bis zum Atlantik reichte.[51] Verlockungen des Handels und der Reichtümer in der islamischen Welt wirkten anziehend auch auf Volksstämme nördlicher Herkunft wie die Waräger. Entlang der Flüsse Oder, Newa, Wolga und Dnepr entstanden im 9. Jahrhundert Stützpunkte und Handelsstationen – und mit den Rus als Namensgebern der Staat Russland. Der über die Flusssysteme Russlands florierende Nord-Süd-Handel unter anderem mit Wachs, Bernstein, Honig, Schwertern und Seidenstoffen erstreckte sich über 5.000 Kilometer, im Norden bis nach Finnland und Norwegen. Schätzungsweise mehrere zehn Millionen bis Hunderte von Millionen Silbermünzen flossen auf diese Weise in den skandinavischen Raum.[52]

Kämpfe ums „Heilige Land“ – die Kreuzzüge
Während im islamischen Kalifat der geistliche Führer zugleich weltlicher Herrscher war, gab es mit dem römischen Papsttum und den Kaisern des Heiligen Römischen Reiches (und weiteren europäischen Monarchien) seit Karl dem Großen zwei Institutionen, die zwar wegen ihrer christlichen Ausrichtung aufeinander bezogen waren, aber zeitweise und besonders im Investiturstreit um die Einsetzung der Bischöfe machtpolitisch heftig miteinander rivalisierten.

Als im 11. Jahrhundert der Herrschaftsbereich der oströmisch-byzantinischen Kaiser zunehmendem Druck seldschukischer Potentaten ausgesetzt war, erging ein Hilferuf an die katholischen Mächte im Westen, der speziell von Papst Urban II. aufgegriffen wurde und in einen Appell an die westliche Christenheit und ihre Ritterschaft mündete, sich auf den Weg zur Befreiung der heiligen Stadt Jerusalem zu machen. Am Ende des daraus entstandenen Ersten Kreuzzugs stand 1099 die in einem wüsten Blutbad endende Eroberung Jerusalems. In dem päpstlichen Aufruf hatte es geheißen, dass denen alle Sünden vergeben würden, die sich dem Kreuzzug anschlössen. Unter den Kreuzzugsbeteiligten herrschte alsbald die Vorstellung, dass der Erlösung sicher sein könne, wer im Kampf fiel. „Der Zug in den Osten war eine lange Reise im diesseitigen Leben, aber auch ein Weg, im nächsten Leben ins Paradies zu gelangen.“[53]


Die Kreuzfahrerstaaten nach dem ersten Kreuzzug
Der Nachschubbedarf der an der Ostküste des Mittelmeers errichteten Kreuzfahrerstaaten beschleunigte den Aufstieg der norditalienischen Stadtstaaten Genua, Pisa und vor allem Venedig von regionalen Machtzentren zu beherrschenden Handelsmächten im Mittelmeerraum. Während die im 12. Jahrhundert sich mehrfach kritisch zuspitzende Lage in den Kreuzfahrerstaaten zu weiteren Kreuzzugsunternehmungen Anlass gab, bauten die Seehandelsmächte Italiens ihre wirtschaftliche Machtstellung aus und trugen ihre Rivalität handfest schließlich sogar in den Straßen Konstantinopels aus. Aus christlicher Verbundenheit mit den Byzantinern wurden zuletzt Hass und erbitterte Feindschaft, die die Stadtbevölkerung zu pogromartigen Ausschreitungen gegen die Italiener trieben.

Nachdem Jerusalem durch Saladin seit 1187 wieder islamischer Herrschaft unterworfen worden war, und der dagegen mobilisierte Dritte Kreuzzug in der Hauptsache keinen Erfolg gebracht hatte, erfuhr der Vierte Kreuzzug in seinem Verlauf eine markante Neubestimmung des Ziels: Statt wie geplant nach Jerusalem und Ägypten zu führen, richtete er sich schließlich gegen das von innerbyzantinischen Machtkämpfen geschwächte Konstantinopel, das 1204 von den Kreuzfahrern belagert, eingenommen und schonungslos geplündert wurde: „Die Reichtümer Konstantinopels verschwanden in den Kirchen, Kathedralen, Klöstern und Privatsammlungen ganz Westeuropas.“[54]

Dort herrschte nach Völkerwanderung und Untergang des Römischen Reiches ein Zustand weitgehender Zersplitterung, in dem konkurrierende Feudalmächte Herrschaft ausübten und auszuweiten suchten. Zentrale Herrschaftsambitionen stießen schnell an Grenzen; denn die Vielfalt der Ethnien und der staatlichen Gebilde stand der Zusammenfassung des Kontinents unter einer Zentralmacht im Wege.[55] Andererseits begünstigte diese Pluralität eine relative politische Autonomie. Als von den norditalienischen Städten ausgehend die Renaissance als geistig-kulturelle Bewegung in Europa Fuß fasste, war damit auch ein verändertes Menschenbild verbunden, das kirchliche Dogmen in Frage zu stellen geeignet war. Die protestantischen Glaubensrichtungen, die sich dem Katholizismus entgegenstellten, lösten einen Prozess aus, an dessen Ende die religiös-weltanschauliche Selbstbestimmung als Menschenrecht stand.[56]

Asiatische Großreiche
Indien wurde nach dem Zerfall des Gupta-Reiches im 6. Jahrhundert, das die klassische Kultur Indiens repräsentierte, in seiner politischen Fragmentierung zum Objekt zahlreicher Eroberungs- und Herrschaftsambitionen benachbarter Völker, blieb aber gesamtgesellschaftlich geprägt durch den Hinduismus und das Kastensystem. Während der Buddhismus zunehmend aus Indien verdrängt wurde, hielt mit den diversen Eroberungsschüben von Norden her der Islam Einzug.[57]

Chinas Einheit, die Ende des 6. Jahrhunderts wiederhergestellt war und sich unter der rund 300-jährigen Tang-Dynastie stabilisierte, blieb durch die Einfälle der zentralasiatischen Reitervölker bedroht. Für annähernd ein Jahrhundert (1279–1368) wurden Mongolen seit Kublai Khan zu Herrschern über China. Der führenden Rolle Chinas im interkontinentalen Handel tat das keinen Abbruch: China exportierte unter anderem Seide, Tee und Porzellan; Papier, Blockdruck und Schießpulver stammen ebenfalls aus China.[58] Für etwa ein Jahrhundert (1220–1335) garantierte das nach Flächenausdehnung größte Weltreich der Geschichte unter dem Mongolen Dschingis Khan und seinen Nachfolgern die Sicherheit des Fernhandels über die Seidenstraße von Europa bis nach Ostasien.

Bis ins späte 11. Jahrhundert waren die Mongolen nur einer von vielen Stämmen nahe der Grenze zu China. Doch Dschingis Khan gelang es mit geschickter Bündnispolitik, straffer Organisation, strategisch zielgerichtetem Vorgehen und einem meritokratischen System der Posten- und Beuteverteilung, das persönliche Bindung und Loyalität förderte, sich im Rahmen eines nahezu ununterbrochenen Eroberungsprogramms zum alleinigen Herrscher der mongolischen Steppe zu machen und sodann einerseits nach Nordchina und andererseits nach Zentralasien auszugreifen. Die Vorgehensweise bestand in äußerst brutaler, selektiver Gewaltanwendung: „Die Eroberung und Plünderung einer Stadt sollte alle anderen dazu bringen, sich schnell und ohne Widerstand zu ergeben. […] Nischapur war eine der Städte, die vollständig vernichtet wurden. Jedes Lebewesen – von Frauen, Kindern und Greisen bis hin zu Haus- und Nutztieren – wurde abgeschlachtet. Die Leichen wurden zu riesigen Pyramiden aufgetürmt als grausige Warnung vor den Folgen, die der Widerstand gegen die Mongolen hatte.“ Viele andere Städte zogen es angesichts dessen vor, die Waffen niederzulegen und zu verhandeln. Doch auch die eroberten und verwüsteten Städte wurden unter mongolischer Herrschaft rasch wieder aufgebaut, „wobei man großen Wert auf die Förderung der Künste, des Handwerks und der Güterproduktion legte.“[59]

Nach Abschüttelung der Mongolenherrschaft betrieb China unter der Ming-Dynastie eine expansive Handels- und Militärpolitik, die angesichts der weiter bestehenden Unsicherheit und der verbreiteten Pest entlang der Seidenstraße ihren Höhepunkt in großen Seeexpeditionen im 15. Jahrhundert erreichte. China war zu diesem Zeitpunkt die mit Abstand größte Seemacht der Welt. Zwischen 1417 und 1422 erreichte eine Flotte des muslimischen Admiral Zheng He zweimal die Küste Ostafrikas bis hinunter nach Mosambik.[60] Im Zuge von Wirtschaftskrisen und Katastrophen kam es zu einer von konfuzianischem Gedankengut getragenen Strategie konservativer Selbstbeschränkung: Das Land orientierte sich wieder auf die Förderung der Landwirtschaft. Der Fernhandel, der Bau großer Schiffe und die Fortsetzung der weit vorangeschrittenen technischen Entwicklung wurden unterbunden, und China verfiel in eine Politik des Isolationismus.[61]

Die türkischen Reiche im östlichen und westlichen Zentralasien waren im 7. und 8. Jahrhundert durch chinesische Angriffe vernichtet worden. In der Folge wurden die Türken durch Verlagerung ihrer Aktionsräume zur Bedrohung südlicher und westlicher gelegener Zivilisationszentren von Nordindien bis zur oströmischen Kapitale Konstantinopel, die schließlich 1453 von ihnen erobert wurde.[62]

Feudalismus oder Sklaverei in Afrika

Sklaventransport
Afrikas Bevölkerung südlich der Sahara war von diesen Konstellationen wie auch zunächst von der islamischen Expansion nicht betroffen. Hier war die über Jahrhunderte sich erstreckende Bantuwanderung das wesentliche Veränderungsgeschehen, mit dem vom Kameruner Hochland her in südlicher und östlicher Richtung sich Bauerntum und seit dem 6. Jahrhundert Eisentechnologie ausbreiteten. Im Gegensatz zu den bäuerlichen Gesellschaften Europas und Asiens, in denen seit der Jungsteinzeit durch Viehhaltung eine dicke Humusschicht entstanden war, die den Grund und Boden allmählich zum Wertobjekt gemacht hatte, war diese Schicht in großen Teilen Afrikas oft nur wenige Zentimeter dick und blieb stets gefährdet. Daher spielte in den meisten afrikanischen Regionen südlich der Sahara der Besitz von und die Bindung an den an sich wertlosen Boden eine weitaus geringere Rolle als die Herrschaft über die Menschen, die ihn bestellten.[63] Den Feudalismus nach Art des europäischen Mittelalters gab es in den frühen afrikanischen Königreichen deshalb nicht in gleicher Weise.[64] So waren die von Bertaux als Hegemonien bezeichneten afrikanischen Reiche wie das Reich von Ghana (um 900–1100) meist zentralistisch organisiert; stets gab es eine starke direkte Beziehung der Könige oder Häuptlinge zu ihren Untertanen.[65] Tatsächlich stellte die Versklavung von Kriegsgefangenen stets ein wichtiges Instrument staatlicher afrikanischer Herrschaftsausübung dar. Innerafrikanische Sklavenjagd und Sklavenhandel waren bereits seit der Antike verbreitet. Die Sklaven wurden unter anderem als Zwangsarbeiter in den offenen Salzminen der Sahara eingesetzt, stellten aber andererseits neben Gold das einträglichste Exportgut afrikanischer Händler dar. Oft waren die Sklavenjäger hellhäutige Wüstennomaden, ihre Opfer zumeist schwarze Bauern.[66] Die prä-agrarischen Sammler und Jäger (Pygmäen und San) wichen den Sklavenjägern in Regenwälder und Wüsten als Rückzugsgebiete aus.

Todbringende und innovationsförderliche Pest
Verheerende Seuchen sind in der Menschheitsgeschichte öfters vorgekommen und zum Teil eingehend beschrieben worden, so zum Beispiel die „Pest des Thukydides“ oder die Justinianische Pest. Die welthistorisch stärkste Pest-Verbreitung mit den höchsten Opferzahlen war jedoch mit jener Pest zur Mitte des 14. Jahrhunderts verbunden, deren Schrecken später als Schwarzer Tod erinnert wurden.

Entstehungsbereich und anfängliches Verbreitungsgebiet der grassierenden spätmittelalterlichen Pest war die eurasische Steppe mit einer Kette von Siedlungszentren, die vom Schwarzen Meer bis zur Mandschurei reichte. Neben Ratten können auch Kamele leicht von dem durch Flöhe übertragenen Erreger Yersinia pestis, infiziert werden, dessen Vermehrung bereits durch eine geringfügige klimatische Erwärmung angeregt werden kann.

Ein mongolisches Heer, das 1346 den genuesischen Handelsplatz Caffa belagerte, wurde von der Seuche nahezu komplett vernichtet. Vor dem Abzug der Übriggebliebenen legten die Mongolen aber noch einige an der Krankheit Verstorbene auf Wurfmaschinen und katapultierten sie in die Stadt. In der Folge wurden auch die europäischen Handelswege „zu Schlagadern für die Übertragung des Schwarzen Todes.“[67]

Gegen Ende der 1340er Jahre erreichte die Seuche bayrische wie nordfranzösische Städte und die Häfen der Britischen Inseln, wo bereits vorher eine Agrarkrise zu Hungersnöten geführt hatte. In den Städten und Dörfern Englands überlebte nach zeitgenössischen Berichten kaum ein Zehntel der Bevölkerung, sodass nicht einmal genug Menschen übrig geblieben seien, um die Toten zu bestatten. Ähnliche Schreckensbilder hinterließ die Pest am Südostrand des Mittelmeers mit von Toten übersäten Straßen zwischen Kairo und Palästina. Als die Seuche zu Anfang der 1350er Jahre allmählich nachließ, hatte sie in Europa mindestens ein Drittel der Gesamtbevölkerung hinweggerafft.[68] In manchen Regionen Europas musste man unter dem Druck des daraus folgenden Arbeitskräftemangels und steigender Löhne zur extensiven Landwirtschaft übergehen (Schafzucht), was den Wollexport aufstrebender Gewerbezentren in Flandern und England stimulierte. Auch musste wegen der Zuwanderung in die Städte der Zunftzwang vielerorts gelockert werden, was die Konkurrenz und eine frühkapitalistische Entwicklung der Gewerbe stimulierte.[69] England schaffte in der Folge als erstes Land Europas die Leibeigenschaft ab, was die Entwicklung der Lohnarbeit und eines kapitalistischen Landpachtsystems förderte.

Neuzeitliche Entdeckungen und Umwälzungen
Im 13. Jahrhundert setzte mit der Entwicklung des Fernhandels der Seerepubliken Venedig und Genua eine folgenreiche „maritime Expansion“ konkurrierender europäischer Mächte ein, die den Beteiligten einen machtpolitischen Vorsprung und phantastische Gewinne im Fernhandel verschaffte. Venedig und Genua legten mit ihren Kolonien rund um das Mittelmeer, mit neuen Navigationsmethoden, Formen des Geschäftsverkehrs und einem Netz von Warenlagern und Plantagen die Grundlagen für eine lange währende europäische Vorherrschaft im Welthandel. Der Wert allein der in Genua gestapelten zollpflichtigen Waren war Ende des 13. Jahrhunderts dreimal höher als die Einnahmen des französischen Königs. Die Methoden der Navigation und des Schiffbaus wurden von Portugiesen und Spaniern unter Nutzung auch der im Nordseeraum entwickelten Technik und der Erkenntnisse von Arabern und Chinesen erheblich verbessert. Die Kombination von Rahsegel und arabischem Lateinsegel führte zu wendigen, hochseetüchtigen Schiffen, die auch gegen den Wind kreuzen konnten.[70]


Spanische Galeone (links) trifft auf niederländisches Kriegsschiff (Cornelis Verbeeck, ca. 1618/1620). Entgegen der landläufigen Meinung waren die Galeonen für die damalige Zeit schnell und wendig.
Mit den Entdeckungsfahrten der Portugiesen und Spanier zur See, die der Suche nach alternativen Fernhandelsstraßen zur Seidenstraße dienten, gerieten die bis dahin von der übrigen Welt isolierten Populationen Amerikas in die Interessensphäre der europäischen Seemächte, die von da an Handelsstützpunkte, Kolonien und Kolonialreiche in den ihnen zugänglichen Gebieten rund um den nun erschlossenen Globus errichteten und damit zu einem machtpolitischen Übergewicht über die großen asiatischen Zivilisationen in Indien und China gelangten.[71]

Während Portugal mit seinen Stützpunkten im Indischen Ozean den indischen Außenhandel dominierte, setzte die Errichtung spanischer Kolonien in Mittel- und Südamerika zunächst in der Karibik an, wohin Kolumbus seine Entdeckungsfahrt geführt hatte. Bei der Eroberung Mexikos wirkten sich die mitgebrachten Feuerwaffen der Spanier mitentscheidend aus. Aus Europa eingeschleppte Krankheitserreger, gegen die für die Ansässigen kein Immunschutz bestand, namentlich die Pocken, aber auch Masern, Grippe, Typhus und andere in Europa endemische Krankheiten, reduzierten die Zahl der indigenen Bevölkerung innerhalb der ersten beiden Jahrhunderte nach der Ankunft des Kolumbus um 95 %. Blühende Zivilisationen wie die Mississippi-Kultur kollabierten schon vor Ankunft der Eroberer: Deren Krankheitskeime reisten, schneller als sie selbst, indem sich die Indianer gegenseitig ansteckten. Der Konquistador Hernando de Soto fand daher in Florida und im Tal des Mississippi menschenleere Gegenden und kürzlich aufgegebene Siedlungen vor.[72] Daher brauchten die Eroberer mit den Einheimischen kaum Kompromisse zu schließen, da es aufgrund ihrer geringen Zahl leicht fiel, sie zu vernichten oder in die „Wildnis“ abzudrängen. Sitten und Institutionen wurden in den kolonialen Ablegergesellschaften ebenso weitergeführt wie Sprache und Religion.[73] Ähnlich war es bei der im 17. Jahrhundert verstärkt einsetzenden Besiedlung Nordamerikas durch europäische Kolonisten, die die ansässigen Indianerstämme immer weiter nach Westen verdrängten.

Der in Mexiko geprägte Silberpeso wurde zur ersten global akzeptierten Währung und zu einem wichtigen Zahlungsmittel sogar in China. Der Silberexport nach Spanien führte jedoch zu einer Inflation und zum wirtschaftlichen Niedergang der Kolonialmacht – ein frühes Beispiel für einen Ressourcenfluch.

Im 18. Jahrhundert setzte ein in dieser Geschwindigkeit bis dahin unbekanntes Bevölkerungswachstum in Europa und Teilen Asiens ein, das zu einem Anstieg der Weltbevölkerung von etwa 600 Millionen im Jahr 1700 auf 1 Milliarde um 1804 führte. In Europa und China verdoppelte sich die Bevölkerung in dieser Zeit auf fast 200 (ca. 20 Prozent der Weltbevölkerung) bzw. etwa 300 Millionen Menschen (ca. 30 Prozent). Ursächlich dafür waren vor allem Verbesserungen in der Landwirtschaft: Die Ablösung der Dreifelderwirtschaft durch die Fruchtwechselwirtschaft und die Einführung der Kartoffel als wichtiges Nahrungsmittel in Europa trugen zur Vermeidung von Hungersnöten bei. Die Winterstallfütterung führte hier zur Verbesserung der Versorgung mit tierischem Fett und Eiweiß. Die Protoindustrialisierung zog die Schaffung gewerblicher Zentren der Wollverarbeitung – z. T. auf der Grundlage bäuerlicher Hauswirtschaft – und später der Baumwollverarbeitung nach sich.[74]

Auch in China entwickelten sich Landwirtschaft und Manufakturen unter der Qing-Dynastie rasch: China erreichte einen Anteil von ca. 50 Prozent an der weltweiten Produktion aller Güter. Doch führte nach dem Siebenjährigen Krieg, der faktisch ein erster Weltkrieg war, da er auch in den Kolonien ausgetragen wurde, die Einbindung von immer mehr Regionen Amerikas und Südasiens – und seit den 1820er Jahren auch Chinas – in das System kolonialer Handelsbeziehungen bis zur Teilkolonialisierung,[75] also weg vom System privater Handelsstützpunkte und -monopole hin zu „ungleichen Verträgen“[76] mit weitgehenden Souveränitätseinschränkungen. Die Konsequenz war eine wirtschaftliche Stagnation in großen Teilen der (teil)kolonisierten Welt, die zu Rohstofflieferanten degradiert wurden, was z. B. zur Hungersnot in Bengalen 1770 und Aufständen in Indien und China[77] führte.

Die ökonomische und Wohlstands-Divergenz innerhalb Europas zwischen Nordwesteuropa (vor allem Großbritannien, Niederlande) und dem Rest des Kontinents (Italien, Spanien, Portugal, Deutschland) sowie die Divergenz zwischen Europa und Asien (vor allem Indien, das seit den 1770er Jahren) wurde durch die Handelshegemonie der Niederlande und Englands verstärkt, wofür zeichenhaft der Aufstieg Amsterdams und Londons zu globalen Handels- und Finanzzentren steht. Entscheidende Weichenstellungen zur Globalisierung fanden also bereits im 18. Jahrhundert statt.


Abraham Lincoln
Nordamerika ging einen anderen Weg. Hier dominierte von Anfang an die Siedlungskolonisation. Im Amerikanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieg emanzipierten sich die Kolonisten jedoch von britischer Herrschaft und gründeten mit französischer Unterstützung die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. Die 1789 in Gang kommende Französische Revolution zielte – im Einklang mit den Leitvorstellungen der Aufklärung – ebenfalls auf Menschenrechtsgarantien und eine gewaltenteilende Verfassung. In beiden Fällen änderte sich aber zunächst nichts daran, dass die im transatlantischen Dreieckshandel nach Amerika gelangten afrikanischen Sklaven und ihre Nachfahren versklavt blieben. Die persönliche Freiheit erlangten die nordamerikanischen Sklaven erst im Zuge des Amerikanischen Bürgerkriegs, zu dem es 1860 nach der Wahl Abraham Lincolns, eines gemäßigten Abolitionisten, zum US-Präsidenten kam. Die aus den Umwälzungen der Französischen Revolution resultierende Vorherrschaft Napoleon Bonapartes auf dem europäischen Kontinent, die in Verbindung mit der Kontinentalsperre auch die britische Machtstellung hätte schleifen sollen, endete mit dem Scheitern der Grande Armée im Russlandfeldzug 1812.

Das Zeitalter von etwa 1600 bis 1750 kann als eine zweite Stufe des frühen Anthropozäns betrachtet werden. Durch die Ausbreitung des Seehandels kam es zu einer globalen Verschleppung wie auch zum gezielten Austausch von Pflanzen- und Tierarten (z. B. Kartoffel, Sonnenblume, Tomate, Erdnuss, Mais, Kakaobaum, Wanderratte). Die Kolonisierung führte zur intensiven landwirtschaftlichen Nutzung bisher ungenutzter natürlicher Ressourcen. In Amerika und in Teilen Asiens entstanden neue Siedlungsformen, während gleichzeitig indigene Völker deziminert wurden. Das „fossile“ Anthropozän im Sinne von Paul J. Crutzen, das zunächst durch die Verbrennung von steigenden Mengen an Kohle gekennzeichnet ist und sich auch in deutlichen atmosphärischen Veränderungen niederschlägt,[78] setzte in der folgenden Periode der Industrialisierung und Urbanisierung ein.

Industrialisierung und Imperialismus
Großbritannien hatte sich bei der Niederringung Napoleons in den Befreiungskriegen nicht nur als führende Seemacht der Welt behauptet, sondern war auch Vorreiter der Industriellen Revolution, die hinsichtlich der Bedeutung für die Änderung menschlicher Existenzbedingungen mit dem neolithischen Übergang zur Sesshaftigkeit und zu landwirtschaftlicher Produktion gleichgesetzt wird. Die gesellschaftlichen und naturräumlichen Voraussetzungen für die Einführung maschinengetriebener Produktion in Fabriken waren spätestens seit der Glorreichen Revolution gegeben, die bei der Gentry und im wirtschaftlich aktiven Bürgertum Kräfte und Mittel freigesetzt hatte. Kohle, Eisen und eine bald um Eisenbahnen erweiterte günstige Transportstruktur; Indien als größte Kolonie, die den Baumwollrohstoff für die sich als erste etablierende Textilindustrie lieferte; dazu Absatzmärkte in Europa und im britischen Herrschaftsgebiet sorgten auf lange Zeit für eine überlegene Stellung der britischen Wirtschaft in der Welt.[79]

In mehr oder minder rascher Folge wurde die neue Produktionsweise – vor allem in Verbindung mit Kohlestandorten – außerhalb Englands übernommen: in West- und Mitteleuropa, in den USA, am Ural, in Indien und Japan. Mit der maschinengesteuerten Massenproduktion gingen veränderte gesellschaftliche Verhältnisse einher, die sich in dem Gegensatz von kapitalistischem Wirtschaftsbürgertum und lohnabhängiger Fabrikarbeiterschaft zuspitzten. Aus der Beobachtung von Verelendungserscheinungen bei englischen Fabrikbelegschaften leiteten Friedrich Engels und Karl Marx im Kommunistischen Manifest die Notwendigkeit einer proletarischen Revolution und einer Diktatur des Proletariats ab. Andere Ansätze zur Lösung der sozialen Frage kamen bei der Gründung von Gewerkschaften und in sozialreformerischen Konzepten von staatlicher Seite zum Tragen.


Afrika um 1914
Konkurrenz und Verdrängungswettbewerb der Wirtschaftsunternehmen innerhalb der jeweiligen volkswirtschaftlichen Binnenmärkte prägten in der Folge auch die politischen Vorstellungen von Selbstbehauptung und Machtstellung der Nationalstaaten im Weltmaßstab. Die Inbesitznahme von Kolonien sollte einerseits der Kontrolle und Nutzung von Rohstoffvorräten dienen, andererseits aber auch langfristige Absatzmärkte für eigene industrielle Erzeugnisse sichern. In einem „Klima imperialistischer Torschlusspanik“ kam es zu einem Wettlauf vor allem europäischer Mächte um noch nicht kolonisierte Gebiete der Erde. Die Vorstellung „Weltmacht oder Untergang“ setzte sich in dem erst seit 1871 bestehenden, aber zur industriellen Großmacht gewordenen Deutschen Kaiserreich in der politischen Führung durch und löste einen Flottenrüstungswettlauf mit der etablierten Weltmacht Großbritannien aus. Unter dem Eindruck einer jährlichen Wachstumsrate der Weltbevölkerung, die sich zwischen 1870 und 1913 gegenüber dem halben vorherigen Jahrhundert (1829–1870) im Durchschnitt verdoppelte, kam bei manchen Zeitgenossen die Vorstellung eines schrumpfenden Lebensraums auf, sodass „Kämpfe um Boden“ anständen.[80] In Rassenlehren wurde eine natürliche Überlegenheit der weißen Kolonialherren über die von ihnen Beherrschten konstruiert und propagiert. Von vielen Seiten her ging man daran, den Imperialismus aufgrund seiner vermeintlich missionarisch-zivilisatorischen Funktion oder mit sozialdarwinistischen Argumenten zu legitimieren.

Auf der Berliner Kongokonferenz 1884 wurde praktisch der ganze Kontinent ohne Mitwirkung der Betroffenen unter den interessierten Mächten anhand der Landkarte aufgeteilt; die jeweils zugewiesenen Territorien wurden teils erst danach okkupiert. In eine ähnliche Lage geriet danach auch China, über dessen Aufteilung die involvierten Mächte sich aber nicht einigen konnten. Zudem stießen sie auch auf organisierten Widerstand (Boxeraufstand) von Chinesen. Im Zeitalter des Imperialismus wuchs der Anteil der unter Kontrolle einer überseeischen Kolonialregierung stehenden Territorien von 25 Millionen Quadratkilometern im Jahre 1880 auf 53 Millionen Quadratkilometer 1913.[81]

Weltkriege und globale Vernetzungen
Nach dem Attentat von Sarajevo mündeten die in Bündniskonstellationen fixierten Spannungen und Machtkämpfe der europäischen Mächte einschließlich Russlands in den Ersten Weltkrieg (1914–1918), der ein Massensterben in Grabenkriegen und Materialschlachten samt Giftgaseinsatz auslöste und auch als Luftkrieg sowie mit U-Booten ausgetragen wurde. In seinem Verlauf standen ungefähr 70 Millionen Menschen unter Waffen, und etwa 17 Millionen kostete er das Leben. Durch ihn mitverursacht, kam es 1917 zur Russischen Revolution, die einen das 20. Jahrhundert prägenden Systemgegensatz zwischen der kommunistischen Sowjetunion und den auf die kapitalistische Marktwirtschaft gegründeten westlichen Industrieländern zur Folge hatte.

Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg beschleunigten sich Tempo und globale Ausdehnung der Industrialisierung. Das Zeitalter der Massenproduktion und des Massenkonsums setzte zunächst in den USA ein und wurde durch die Gewinnung und Verbrennung von Erdöl befeuert. Mit Hilfe dieser Energiequelle, die wesentlich energiereicher ist als Kohle, beschleunigten sich die globalen Tendenzen zur gewollten und ungewollten biologischen, klimatischen, geologischen und siedlungsgeographischen Umgestaltung der Erde. Ein massenhafter Individual- und Flugverkehr, die Industrialisierung der Landwirtschaft, die moderne Kunststoffindustrie und Pharmakologie und die Entwicklung von Megacities wurden so erst möglich. Das Anthropozän trat damit in eine neue, heute als kritisch bewertete Phase.

Die nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg geschlossenen Pariser Vorortverträge einschließlich des Versailler Vertrags erreichten keine dauerhafte Stabilisierung der internationalen Beziehungen auf neuer Grundlage, zumal die Weltwirtschaftskrise ab 1929 den Konsolidierungstendenzen entgegenwirkte und in Deutschland die Ablösung der Weimarer Republik durch die Nationalsozialistische Diktatur nach sich zog. Zielstrebig führte Adolf Hitler einen neuen Krieg zur Eroberung von „Lebensraum“ für das deutsche Volk herbei, der in den Zweiten Weltkrieg mündete. In dessen Schatten wurde die Diskriminierung und Verfolgung der Juden zum Holocaust gesteigert. Mit dem Angriff auf Pearl Harbor und die USA begann Japan einen Kampf um die Vorherrschaft in Ostasien. Die Gesamtzahl der Kriegstoten wird auf 60–70 Millionen geschätzt. Mit dem Abwurf der Atombomben auf die japanischen Städte Hiroshima und Nagasaki endete der Zweite Weltkrieg und begann das Atomzeitalter.

Bestrebungen zur Friedenssicherung und zur Ächtung des Krieges als Mittel der Politik sind zwischen und nach den Weltkriegen verstärkt zum Zuge gekommen. Der globalen institutionellen Sicherung des Weltfriedens sollten die Gründung des Völkerbunds 1920 und die Gründung der Vereinten Nationen 1945 dienen. Letztere sind zugleich auf den universellen Schutz der Menschenrechte ausgerichtet. Mit dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs war auch eine verstärkte Dekolonisation verbunden, bei der beispielsweise Indien unter der Führung Mahatma Gandhis 1947 die Unabhängigkeit erlangte. Die von den Kolonialmächten am Reißbrett fixierten Grenzen in Afrika trugen ihren Teil zu den anhaltenden Entwicklungsproblemen der postkolonialen souveränen Staaten dieses Kontinents bei.

Mit der Aufteilung Deutschlands unter den Siegermächten der Anti-Hitler-Koalition begann ein Prozess der Blockbildung, in dem die nunmehrigen Supermächte USA und UdSSR auf beiden Seiten des „Eisernen Vorhangs“ die Führung ausübten und durch wechselseitige atomare Rüstung und Abschreckung im Kalten Krieg verharrten. Während China unter der Führung Mao Zedongs zur Volksrepublik wurde und sich in die sozialistisch-kommunistische Staatenwelt einfügte, entwickelte sich das besiegte Japan zu einer mit den USA verbündeten weltwirtschaftlichen Großmacht.

Infolge der durch Wirtschaftsprobleme im Ostblock mitbedingten Abkehr Gorbatschows von der Breschnew-Doktrin gewannen die vormaligen „Satellitenstaaten“ der Sowjetunion ihre Selbstständigkeit zurück. Mit dem Fall des Eisernen Vorhangs gingen die Auflösung des Ostblocks und die Überwindung der Teilung Europas einher. Wende und friedliche Revolution in der DDR, der Fall der Berliner Mauer, die deutsche Wiedervereinigung und der Zerfall der Sowjetunion gehören zu den so angestoßenen Folgeprozessen. An die Stelle der bipolaren Supermächte-Konfrontation trat mit Auflösung der Sowjetunion eine zunehmend multipolare Weltordnung, in der neben den USA, Russland und einer um mittel- und osteuropäische Länder erweiterten Europäischen Union vor allem das bevölkerungsreiche und durch Einbeziehung von Merkmalen kapitalistischer Marktwirtschaft erstarkte China an Macht und Einfluss gewinnt.

Gleichzeitig stiegen in zahlreichen Ländern Staats- und private Verschuldung auf ein bisher unbekanntes Maß, so dass seit Ende der 1990er Jahre die Verhinderung von Finanzkrisen fast permanent auf der Tagesordnung internationaler Institutionen steht. Dennoch kam es zur Weltfinanzkrise 2007–09. Nicht zuletzt wegen stark schwankender Rohstoffpreise folgten weitere Schuldenkrisen vieler Schwellenländer. Diese waren schon seit den 1970er Jahren immer wieder von Wachstumsverlusten,[82] der Verarmung breiter Schichten und einem Erstarken von Nationalismus und religiösem Fundamentalismus betroffen. In der islamischen Staatenwelt kam es zu einer Reihe von Aufständen, darunter der arabische Frühling, und zu kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen, teils mit der Folge massenhafter Fluchtbewegungen und gespeist von der Verfügungsmacht über Ölquellen oder vom weiterhin ungelösten Nahostkonflikt. Terrornetzwerke wie al Qaida oder Islamischer Staat werden weltweit als Bedrohung von Frieden und innerer Sicherheit wahrgenommen und unter anderem durch Militärbündnisse bekämpft.

Der in den Vereinten Nationen gegebene Ansatz zu einer Weltinnenpolitik wird durch einen nahezu alle menschlichen Lebens- und Betätigungsfelder betreffenden Globalisierungsprozess fundiert und erweitert, ist jedoch vor allem in Krisensituationen durch Rückschläge und national-populistische Bewegungen gefährdet. Computertechnologie, Internet und mobile Kommunikation ermöglichen Kontaktaufnahme, Informationsaustausch und unmittelbare Einflussnahme zeitgleich überall auf der Welt. Weitere technologische Bereiche des frühen 21. Jahrhunderts betreffen ebenfalls künstliche Intelligenz, Robotik, das Internet der Dinge, 3D-Druck und autonome Mobilität. Die Technikfolgenabschätzung beschäftigt sich infolgedessen mit den z. B. gesellschaftlichen Chancen und Risiken des technologischen Fortschritts. Der die kollektive und individuelle menschliche Wirklichkeit zunehmend bestimmende Prozess weltweiter Verflechtungen und Wechselwirkungen zeigt sich unter anderem im Erwerbsleben, in der Freizeitgestaltung (samt massenhaftem Ferntourismus) sowie in zunehmender innergesellschaftlicher Multikulturalität.

Infolge des globalen menschengemachten Einflusses auf die biologischen, geologischen und atmosphärischen Prozesse auf der Erde samt Klimawandel und dessen Folgen wird mit dem Begriff Anthropozän neuerdings eine Verbindung hergestellt zwischen erdgeschichtlichen Epochen und der Menschheitsgeschichte.[83] Der von Paul Crutzen im Jahr 2000 geprägte Begriff beschäftigt unterdessen nicht nur Geowissenschaftler, sondern wird unter Mitwirkung u. a. von Kulturwissenschaftlern interdisziplinär untersucht. Die Anthropocene Working Group der International Commission on Stratigraphy hat vorgeschlagen, die Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts als Beginn des Anthropozäns zu bestimmen.[84][85]
Poor Things is a 2023 film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and written by Tony McNamara, based on the 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray. A co-production between Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the film stars Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Christopher Abbott, and Jerrod Carmichael.[5] It focuses on Bella Baxter, a woman in Victorian London who is brought back to life via brain transplant and embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery.

Principal photography took place in Hungary from August to December 2021. Poor Things premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2023, and won the Golden Lion there. The film was released theatrically in the United States on December 8, 2023, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on January 12, 2024, by Searchlight Pictures. It received critical acclaim and has grossed over $112 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million.

Poor Things was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and received various accolades, including four wins at the 96th Academy Awards, two wins at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, and five wins at the 77th British Academy Film Awards, with Stone winning Best Actress at each of these ceremonies.

Plot
In Victorian London,[n 1] the medical student Max McCandles becomes an assistant to the eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter. Max falls in love with Godwin's ward, Bella, a childlike young woman. Godwin reveals that the woman, who was pregnant, killed herself by leaping off a bridge. Godwin replaced the woman's brain with that of her fetus, resulting in her having an infant's mind, and named her Bella Baxter.

With Godwin's encouragement, Max asks for Bella's hand in marriage. Bella accepts, but as her intelligence rapidly develops, she becomes curious about the outside world and herself. While exploring her own body, she discovers masturbation and sexual pleasure. She runs off with Duncan Wedderburn, a debauched lawyer whom Godwin hired to overhaul the nuptial contract. Deciding to let her go, Godwin begins a new experiment with a young woman, Felicity, who matures much more slowly than Bella.

Bella and Duncan embark on a grand journey, beginning in Lisbon, where they have frequent sex. When Bella becomes difficult for him to control, Duncan smuggles her onto a cruise ship. Bella befriends two passengers, who open her mind to philosophy. Duncan attempts to stunt her growth to no avail. He becomes exasperated and indulges in drinking and gambling. During a stop at Alexandria, Bella witnesses the suffering of the poor and becomes distraught. She entrusts Duncan's winnings to unscrupulous members of the crew, who falsely promise to give it to the needy. Unable to afford the rest of the trip, Bella and Duncan are dropped off at Marseille and make their way to Paris. Seeking money and accommodation, Bella begins working at a brothel. Duncan, enraged, has a breakdown and Bella abandons him. At the brothel, she comes under the tutelage of Madame Swiney and begins a relationship with a prostitute, Toinette, who introduces her to socialism.

Godwin, now terminally ill, asks Max to bring Bella to him. Max locates her after tracking down Duncan, who has been institutionalized. Back in London, Bella reconciles with Godwin and renews her plans to marry Max. The wedding is interrupted by Duncan and General Alfie Blessington. The latter, addressing Bella as Victoria, declares that they were married before her disappearance and that he has come to reclaim her. She abandons Max to learn of her past life, but discovers Alfie's violent and sadistic nature and realizes Victoria committed suicide to escape him.

Alfie confines Bella to his mansion. He unsuccessfully threatens her at gunpoint to submit to genital mutilation, demanding she drink a sedative. She tosses the sedative in his face, and after a struggle, Alfie accidentally shoots himself in the foot before passing out. Godwin dies peacefully with Bella and Max at his side. Bella decides to follow Godwin's footsteps by becoming a surgeon with the help of Max and Toinette and transplants a goat's brain into Alfie's head.

Production
Development

Director and co-producer Yorgos Lanthimos
Produced by Film4 Productions, Element Pictures, TSG Entertainment, and Searchlight Pictures, development on the film began as early as 2009, when Lanthimos went to Scotland to discuss the acquisition of the rights to "Poor Things" with the author, Alasdair Gray. "He was a very lovely man," Lanthimos said, "Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don't know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'" Lanthimos said Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed Lanthimos several places that he had incorporated into the story.[7]

While filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who had starred in that film. Lanthimos began developing Poor Things more actively following the success of The Favourite: "After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray's book and said, 'This is what I want to do.' It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind." While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated on the short film Bleat (2022).[8]

Pre-production
Poor Things was announced in February 2021.[9] Lanthimos felt that working with Stone again gave him an advantage to the production, as they had developed a mutual trust. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different in comparison to The Favourite because she also acted as a producer: "It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn't go anywhere."[8]

Casting
Willem Dafoe entered negotiations to join the cast in March 2021.[10] By April, Ramy Youssef was in talks to join.[11] Dafoe and Youssef were confirmed to join in May, with Mark Ruffalo and Jerrod Carmichael also added to the cast in May.[12][13] In September, Christopher Abbott was cast.[14] In November, Margaret Qualley and Suzy Bemba were cast,[15] with Kathryn Hunter revealing she had a role in the film as well.[16]

In preparation for her role, Stone took dance lessons and dyed her hair black, which she admitted was accidental. Lanthimos reflected that the dark hair contrasted with Stone's fair complexion so much that they agreed to go forward with the look.[17][18] Describing her characterization of Bella, Stone was attracted to the idea of portraying a woman reborn with a liberated mindset free from societal pressures:
"It's such a fairy tale, and a metaphor—clearly, this can't actually happen—but the idea that you could start anew as a woman, as this body that's already formed, and see everything for the first time and try to understand the nature of sexuality, or power, or money or choice, the ability to make choices and live by your own rules and not society's—I thought that was a really fascinating world to go into."

Stone especially appreciated Bella's lack of shame in regards to her experiences:
Even though Bella has obviously been through trauma in her life, it just isn't there for her now. She was the most joyous character in the world to play, because she has no shame about anything. She's new, you know? I've never had to build a character before that didn't have things that had happened to them or had been put on them by society throughout their lives. It was an extremely freeing experience to be her.[8]

Youssef revealed that in preparation for their roles, he and Dafoe attended mortician school. Reflecting on the "experimental theater games" Lanthimos assigned the cast prior filming, Dafoe shared, "You're very patient with everyone, and everyone's patient with you. They need to be confident in what they're doing, because what we're doing is quite risky. It's not a normal film."[17] Additionally, Dafoe spent six hours each day in the hair and makeup department – four hours getting extensive prosthetics applied to his face at the start of the day and two hours to get it all taken off at the end of the day.[19]

Discussing the male characterizations, Lanthimos acknowledged that while each male character was different and had his own individual motivation, they each represented male attitudes typical of the story's Victorian setting. Lanthimos stated:
"There are variations, I guess, but in this film, there's a general tendency to try to control [Bella]—even if it's done in a caring or subtle way, in the way that a parent might or that [Dafoe's character] Baxter does, or just being infatuated in the way that Ramy is. You know, being a nice man deep down, but still having the characteristics of a man of that era."

Stone also asserted that "the more agency Bella gets, the more she learns and grows, the more it drives these men insane. The more she has an opinion and her own wants and needs and all of that, it makes them crazy; they want her to stay this sort of pure thing."[8]

Filming
Principal photography took place in Hungary, beginning in August 2021 at Origo Studios in Budapest[20] and wrapping that December.[21] It is the first feature-film to be partially shot on Kodak's 35mm Ektachrome color reversal motion picture film stock since its revival in 2018.[22]

Influences
According to cinematographer Robbie Ryan, Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula served as the main source of inspiration to everyone making the picture and the movie that was referred to more than most.[23] Other films that served as general influences were Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's Black Narcissus, Federico Fellini's And The Ship Sails On and several films by Roy Andersson.[24]

Costumes
Lanthimos worked closely with costume designer Holly Waddington to reflect Bella's growth and development through her wardrobe, from the more puffy silhouettes of her childlike era to the nearly corseted gown she wears at the film's climax.[25][26][27]

Stone further elaborated on Bella's growth reflected through her costumes, detailing how in the beginning of the story she dresses in more traditional clothing of the era, and, following her transformation, begins to dress herself in more bizarre clothes. Stone said:
"I loved that element of, how would Bella put clothing together with the way her mind works at this point? At the end, there are these very military-looking dresses that look like nothing you've seen Bella wear; things are much more form-fitting and constrained, but that's because she's come to a place where she's grown and decided who she is and what she's going to do. She's not assimilating, necessarily, but there's just more structure there."[8]

Music
Main article: Poor Things (soundtrack)
The film was scored by pop musician Jerskin Fendrix in his feature debut. The soundtrack album was released by Milan Records in conjunction with the film's release date, December 8, 2023. Two singles, "Bella" and "Lisbon", were released on November 14.[28]

Genre
David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter described Poor Things as "genre-defying".[29] Critics have described its genre as a sex comedy, gothic comedy, black comedy, and an absurdist comedy.[30][31][29] Some noted steampunk elements in the visual design.[32][6][33][34]

Release
Poor Things had its world premiere at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2023,[35] and was also screened at the Telluride Film Festival, the New York Film Festival, the BFI London Film Festival, the Busan International Film Festival, and the Sitges Film Festival.[36][37][38][39][40] The film had a limited theatrical release by Searchlight Pictures in the United States on December 8, 2023, and began a wide release on January 19, 2024.[41][42] It was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on January 12, 2024.[43] It was previously scheduled to be released on September 8, 2023,[44][45] but was delayed to its December date due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[41]

Home media
Poor Things was released on digital platforms on February 27, 2024,[46] and became available for streaming on Hulu in the United States on March 7, 2024[47] and on Disney+ in Canada the same day.[48] The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 12, 2024.[46]

Reception
Box office
As of March 20, 2024, Poor Things has grossed $34.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $78.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $112.8 million.[3][4]

In its limited opening weekend, it made $644,000 from nine theaters, a per-venue average of $71,556 (the third-best of 2023).[49] Expanding to 82 theaters the following weekend, it made $2.2 million, finishing in 10th.[50] In its third weekend it made $2.4 million from 800 theaters, and a total of $3.4 million over the four-day Christmas frame.[51] Following its 11 Oscar nominations, it expanded from 900 theaters to 2,300 in its eighth week of release and made $3.08 million, an increase of 43% from the previous weekend.[52] The following weekend it made $2.2 million.[53]

Critical response
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 364 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: "Wildly imaginative and exhilaratingly over the top, Poor Things is a bizarre, brilliant tour de force for director Yorgos Lanthimos and star Emma Stone."[54] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[55] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while 68% of those polled by PostTrak called the film "excellent", with 75% saying they would definitely recommend it.[49] Glamour wrote that the film "received widespread critical acclaim following its world premiere" and that Stone was "praised for her hilariously bold and fearless sex scenes" in it.[56]

Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that Poor Things is "Lanthimos' finest film so far, a strange, gorgeous-looking picture that extends generosity both to its characters and the audience". She found Stone's performance "wonderful—vital, exploratory, almost lunar in its perfect oddness".[57] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it a "virtuoso comic epic" and added that Stone had given a "hilarious, beyond-next-level performance".[58] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter termed it "an insanely enjoyable fairy tale", adding that Stone "gorges on it in a fearless performance that traces an expansive arc most actors could only dream about".[29] Variety's Guy Lodge also believed that the film "rests on a single astonishing performance by Stone".[59]

BBC Culture's Nicholas Barber found the film "outrageous and hilarious", comparing it to the work of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam. The review also noted that the novel's realistic nineteenth-century setting had been changed to a fantastical "steam-punk wonderland", and that some of its satirical humor and most of its socialist and feminist themes had been toned down.[60] Reviews by The Guardian,[58] Variety[59] and Entertainment Weekly[61] also underline the steampunk elements of the setting. Conversely, Manohla Dargis, chief critic of The New York Times, was not as impressed. She felt the story became more "monotonal, flat and dull" over time, writing that the movie's "design is rich, its ideas thin. … It isn't long into Poor Things that you start to feel as if you were being bullied into admiring a film that's so deeply self-satisfied there really isn't room for the two of you". Nevertheless, she too lauded Stone's acting.[62]

Ramin Setoodeh and Zack Sharf in Variety commented, "But not everyone loved Poor Things. A stream of [Venice] theatergoers bolted for the exit during some of the racier scenes."[63] Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle called the film "a 141-minute mistake" and asserted, "Worst of all, it's dishonest. It purports to be a feminist document, but it defines a woman's autonomy as the ability to be exploited and not care. ... What version of feminism are these guys—Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara—trying to sell us here?"[64] Film critic Scott Mantz applauded LaSalle's post, finding the film "a seriously misguided take on female empowerment", though he praised the film's ambition and production values.[65]

Angelica Jade Bastién of Vulture warned readers, "This isn't a sincere treatise on female sexuality, it's a dark comedy for people who carry around an NPR tote bag", and criticized the film for failing to take a "sincere interest in the interior conflicts" of its female protagonist. Bastién identified the decision to make Bella Baxter mentally a child as the "primary failure of Poor Things' sex scenes", citing Bella's depiction as an example of the 'born sexy yesterday' trope. "In many ways", she commented, "the film demonstrates the limits of the modern cis-male auteur's vision for and about women—particularly their sexual selves." Praise was saved for Holly Waddington's costuming which Bastién declared "the greatest triumph of the film".[66]

The film has been subject to scrutiny in Gray's native Scotland due to its seeming disregard for the source material and its Scottish roots,[67] with online documentary channel Ossian presenting a portrayal of the true origins of Poor Things and its original Scottish setting.[68] Those closest to Gray have suggested that Lanthimos's interpretation of the source material was something Gray himself agreed to in the early 2010s, when contractual terms for a screenplay were drawn up.[69]

Born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child in a theater production of The Wind in the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles and made her television debut in In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she appeared in a series of well-received teen comedy films, such as Superbad (2007), Zombieland (2009), and Easy A (2010), which was Stone's first leading role. Following this breakthrough, she starred in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the period drama The Help (2011), and gained wider recognition as Gwen Stacy in the 2012 superhero film The Amazing Spider-Man and its 2014 sequel.

Early life and education
Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company, and Krista Jean Stone (née Yeager), a homemaker.[4][5] She lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from ages 12 to 15.[6][7] She has a younger brother, Spencer.[8] Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that anglicized their surname to "Stone". She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.[9]


Valley Youth Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, where Stone appeared in sixteen productions
As an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child.[10] She has said she was "loud" and "bossy" while growing up.[11] Stone was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has said that her controlling nature meant that "I made sure I got all A's".[12] Stone suffered panic attacks and anxiety as a child,[13] which she says caused a decline in her social skills.[14] She underwent therapy but said it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks; she recalled:

The first time I had a panic attack I was sitting in my friend's house, and I thought the house was burning down. I called my mom and she brought me home, and for the next three years it just would not stop. I would go to the nurse at lunch most days and just wring my hands. I would ask my mom to tell me exactly how the day was going to be, then ask again 30 seconds later. I just needed to know that no one was going to die and nothing was going to change.[13]

Stone wanted to act since age four;[7] she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus to musical theater, and took vocal lessons for several years.[15] Her acting debut, at age 11, came in a stage production of The Wind in the Willows, playing Otter.[16] Stone was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in 16 productions at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre—including The Princess and the Pea, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat[4]—and performed with the theater's improvisational comedy troupe.[17] Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role on Nickelodeon's All That.[1] Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.[5]

Stone attended Xavier College Preparatory—an all-girl Catholic high school—as a freshman, but dropped out after one semester to become an actress.[4] She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled "Project Hollywood" (featuring Madonna's 2003 song "Hollywood") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career.[15] In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalled, "I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom", adding, "I ended up getting none."[7] Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.[5][13]

Career
Career beginnings (2004–2009)
Stone made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004). The resulting show, retitled The New Partridge Family (2004), remained an unsold pilot.[18] She followed this with a guest appearance in Louis C.K.'s HBO series Lucky Louie.[13] She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama Heroes (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her "rock bottom" experience.[5] In April 2007, she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama Drive, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.[4] Stone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola's comedy Superbad (2007), co-starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play Hill's romantic interest, she dyed her hair red.[19] A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter found her "appealing", but felt that her role was poorly written.[20] Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as "amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I've had since then".[21] The film was a commercial success, and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face.[22][23]


Stone in 2009
The next year, Stone starred in the comedy The Rocker (2008) as Amelia Stone, the "straight face" bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role.[24] The actress, who has called herself "a big smiler and laugher", said she found it difficult to play a character whose personality was so different from her own. The film and her performance received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure.[25][26] Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box office, becoming a moderate commercial success.[27] The film saw her play the president of a sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses' 1982 song "I Know What Boys Like".[28] Reviews were generally negative,[29] but Stone was praised,[30] with TV Guide's Ken Fox writing that she "is well on her way to becoming a star".[31]

Stone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters's Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Loosely based on Charles Dickens's 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, but it was a modest commercial success.[32][33] Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer's $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film Zombieland,[34] in which she features alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a zombie apocalypse, in a role which Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine thought was "somewhat underwritten."[35] In a more positive review, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph called "the hugely promising Stone […] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years".[36] Stone's third release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney's Paper Man, a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.[37]

Rise to prominence (2010–2013)
Stone voiced an Australian Shepherd in Marmaduke (2010), a comedy from director Tom Dey based on Brad Anderson's long-running comic strip of the same name.[38] Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in Easy A, a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck.[39][40] Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter, the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script "so different and unique from anything I'd read before", calling it "funny and sweet". When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition.[41] The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone's performance was considered its prime asset.[42] Anna Smith of Time Out wrote, "Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth."[43] The film was a commercial success, grossing $75 million against its $8 million budget.[44] Stone was nominated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.[45]


Stone promoting The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012
In October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC's sketch comedy Saturday Night Live; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to Lindsay Lohan.[46] Stone called it "the greatest week of my life".[7][47] She hosted again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015.[48] A brief appearance in the sex comedy Friends with Benefits (2011) reunited her with Gluck.[49] She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) alongside Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore. The film featured her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling's character. Despite finding "some inevitable collapses into convention" in the film, Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Stone "ties the whole film together".[50] At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards, she won the Choice Movie Actress – Comedy award for her performance in the film.[51] Crazy, Stupid, Love was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.[52]

Dismayed at being typecast as "the sarcastic interest of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found challenging.[53] The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work on the film. The director said, "[Stone] was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter."[54] She was cast as Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she learned to speak in a Southern accent and educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film.[55] With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a $25 million budget, The Help became Stone's highest-grossing film to that point.[56] The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought Stone was "well-meaning and hugely likable" despite finding flaws in the character.[57] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,[58] and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.[59][60]

Stone turned down a role in the action comedy 21 Jump Street after signing on to Marc Webb's 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series.[61][62] She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the titular superhero (played by Andrew Garfield).[63] Stone returned to her natural blonde hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously.[64][65] She admitted to having never read the comics, and therefore felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man: "My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love",[66] adding that she was only familiar with Stacy's character as portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard in Spider-Man 3.[67][68] The Amazing Spider-Man was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of the year with global revenues of $757.9 million.[69] Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone to be "irresistible",[70] and Ian Freer of Empire was particularly impressed with Stone's and Garfield's performances.[71] At the annual People's Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress.[72] Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game Sleeping Dogs, which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female.[73]

Stone began 2013 with a voice role in the DreamWorks Animation film The Croods, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[74] This followed with an appearance in Movie 43, an anthology film which consists of 16 short stories—she played the title role in the segment entitled "Veronica".[75] She next starred alongside Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn in Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s.[76] A. O. Scott of The New York Times dismissed the film as "a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits", but praised Stone's pairing with Gosling.[77] She expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.[78]

Established actress (2014–2017)
In 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. She believed that her character did not depend on the film's protagonist, asserting: "She saves him more than he saves her. She's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He's the muscle, she's the brains."[79] Her performance was well received by critics;[80] an Empire reviewer commended her for standing out in the film, writing, "Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character."[81] The role won her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards.[82] Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen's romantic comedy Magic in the Moonlight, a modest commercial success.[83] A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as "the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect".[84]

The black comedy Birdman, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, was Stone's final film release of 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, it featured her as Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter.[85] Birdman was critically acclaimed,[86] and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture.[87] The Movie Network deemed it one of Stone's best performances to date, and Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph found her to be "superb" and "tremendous" in her role, while also highlighting her monologue in the film which he believed to have been "delivered like a knitting needle to the gut."[88][89] She received Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award nominations.[90]


Stone at a screening of La La Land (2016); her performance in the film won her the Academy Award for Best Actress
From November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical Cabaret as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams.[91] Deeming it "the most nerve-racking thing ever", Stone listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role.[92][93] Marilyn Stasio of Variety was critical of her singing abilities and found her performance to be "a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy."[94] Both of Stone's 2015 films—the romantic comedy Aloha, and the drama Irrational Man—were critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics.[83][95] In Cameron Crowe's Aloha, she played the role of an air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in Woody Allen's Irrational Man, she played the love interest of Joaquin Phoenix's character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast, as Stone's character was meant to be of Asian, Hawaiian, and Swedish descent. She later regretted taking part in the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood.[96] Despite the backlash, Stone was nominated for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.[97] She also appeared in the music video for Will Butler's single "Anna".[98]

During her run on Cabaret, Stone met filmmaker Damien Chazelle, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama La La Land.[99] The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, starred Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles.[100] Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[101][102] For the film's soundtrack, she recorded six songs.[b] La La Land served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, where it generated critical acclaim and earned Stone the Volpi Cup for Best Actress.[104] It emerged as a commercial success, with a worldwide gross of over $440 million against a production budget of $30 million.[105] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that "Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears."[106] For her performance, Stone won the Academy, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA Award for Best Actress.[107]

Stone's sole release of 2017 was Battle of the Sexes, based on the 1973 eponymous match between tennis players Billie Jean King (Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell). In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, worked with a dialect coach to speak in King's accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain 15 pounds (6.8 kg).[108][109] The film premiered to positive reviews at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and certain critics considered Stone's performance to be the finest of her career.[110] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian praised her for playing against type, and for being "strong" and "convincing" in the part.[111] Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget.[112] Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.[113]

Films with Yorgos Lanthimos and professional expansion (2018–present)
In 2018, Stone and Rachel Weisz played Abigail Masham and Sarah Churchill, two cousins fighting for the affection of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), in Yorgos Lanthimos's historical comedy-drama The Favourite. She found it challenging to be an American among an all-British cast, and struggled with mastering her character's accent.[114] The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival to critical acclaim.[115] Michael Nordine of IndieWire praised Stone for taking on such a bold role following the success of La La Land, and termed the three lead actresses "a majestic triumvirate in a period piece that's as tragic as it is hilarious."[116] Stone then executive-produced and starred in the Netflix dark comedy miniseries Maniac (2018), directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga. It featured Stone and Hill as two strangers whose lives are transformed due to a mysterious pharmaceutical trial. An admirer of Fukunaga's work, she agreed to the project without reading the script.[117] Judy Berman of Time magazine was impressed with Stone and Hill for their growth as actors since Superbad and noted the complexity in their performances.[118] Stone received her fifth Golden Globe nomination and third Oscar nomination for The Favourite, and additionally earned SAG nominations for both Maniac and The Favourite.[119][120][121] That same year, Stone appeared in Paul McCartney's music video for his song "Who Cares".[122]


Stone collaborated with director Yorgos Lanthimos on several projects, most notably The Favourite (2018) and Poor Things (2023)
Stone reprised her role as Wichita in Zombieland: Double Tap (2019), the sequel to 2009's Zombieland, which received mixed reviews and grossed $125 million worldwide.[123][124] She narrated the Netflix documentary series The Mind, Explained (2019) and reprised the voice role of Eep in The Croods: A New Age (2020), the sequel to 2013's The Croods.[125][126][127] In 2021, Stone played Cruella de Vil (originated by Glenn Close in the previous live-action adaptations) in Craig Gillespie's crime comedy Cruella, a Disney live-action based on the 1961 animation One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Starring opposite Emma Thompson, Stone also served as an executive producer of the film alongside Close.[128][129] The film was released in US theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access to positive reviews and grossed $233 million worldwide against its $100 million budget.[130][131] Justin Chang of Los Angeles Times wrote that despite the film's flawed screenplay, Stone was "wholly committed, glammed-to-the-nines"; Chang favorably compared it with her performance in The Favourite, adding that she "nailed every nuance as another lowly young woman turned ambitious schemer".[132] For Cruella, Stone garnered another Golden Globe nomination.[133]

In 2020, Stone and her husband, Dave McCary, launched the production company Fruit Tree.[134] Their first project was the independent film When You Finish Saving the World, which marked Jesse Eisenberg's feature directorial debut.[135] The film premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, and had modest reviews.[136][137] The company's next release was the comedy Problemista, directed by Julio Torres.[138] It premiered at the 2023 South by Southwest, and was initially scheduled to be released that year, but was delayed due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[139][140] Both films were produced in collaboration with A24.[141]

Continuing her collaboration with Lanthimos, Stone starred in his short film Bleat (2022) and feature film Poor Things (2023).[142] The latter, a fantasy coming-of-age film, is based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray.[143] Stone also produced the film, in which she starred as Bella, a young Victorian woman who is crudely resurrected after her suicide. She found the experience of playing a character liberated of societal pressures to be "extremely freeing",[144] and she performed nudity and several sex scenes in it.[145] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Stone "gorges on it in a fearless performance that traces an expansive arc most actors could only dream about", and particularly praised her ability to perform physical comedy.[146] Stephanie Zacharek of Time termed her performance "wonderful—vital, exploratory, almost lunar in its perfect oddness".[147] Stone next executive produced and starred in the Showtime satirical comedy series The Curse.[148] She played Whitney, an influencer who hosts an HGTV show with her husband.[149] Commenting on her achievements of the year, BBC Culture's Caryn James opined that "Stone has quickly moved past Hollywood stardom to claim serious artistic credentials".[150] She received two more Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress for her performances in Poor Things and The Curse, winning for the former.[151][152] Also for Poor Things, she won her second Academy Award and BAFTA for Best Actress in addition to a Best Picture nomination.[153][154]

The 2024 Sundance Film Festival marked the release of two films produced by Stone for Fruit Tree — the horror film I Saw the TV Glow and Eisenberg's second directorial, A Real Pain.[155] Stone will next team with Lanthimos once again in the anthology film Kinds of Kindness,[156] and will star in Ari Aster's contemporary Western film Eddington.[157]

Reception and acting style
Commenting on her performance in The Help, Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter called her "one of our very best young actresses".[158] She is known for starring both in high-profile, mainstream productions and in low-budget independent films. Time's Daniel D'Addario describes the latter as "substantive risk" and adds that taking on a role in them provides her an opportunity to "try something new and to get credibility".[159] Analyzing her on-screen persona, Jessica Kiang of IndieWire noted that Stone "usually [plays] the approachable, down-to-earth, girl-next-door type, [and] in person she demonstrates many of those qualities too, along with an absolute refusal to take herself too seriously."[160]


Stone at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con. Her hair, eyes, and husky voice have been described by the media as her trademarks.[161][162]
Biographer Karen Hollinger wrote that at the beginning of her career, Stone was often labeled a "star ingénue", a perceived limitation she escaped despite not being a classically trained actress. Hollinger attributed Stone's success as an actress to her willingness to rely on her acting talent rather than off-screen personae. As such, Stone "crafted a brilliant career based on performative skills, careful choice of roles and distinctive personality". She was further praised as a performer who "eschew[ed] glamour and the trappings of the 'starlet'" and established a career through "talent, diligent work, and often surprising, unconventional characterizations".[163] In a 2024 analysis of Stone's career trajectory, IndieWire suggested that from breakout roles to acclaimed performances in indie films, Stone is positioned as a potential new movie star in Hollywood's evolving landscape, citing her versatility and critical acclaim as significant factors in her rise.[164]

In 2008, Stone topped Saturday Night Magazine's Top 20 Rising Stars Under 30 and was included in a similar list compiled by Moviefone.[165][166] LoveFilm placed her on their list of 2010 Top 20 Actresses Under 30, and her performance in Easy A was included in Time's Top 10 Everything of 2010.[167][168] She appeared in the 2013 Celebrity 100 list, a compilation of the 100 most powerful people in the world, as selected annually by Forbes. The magazine reported that she had earned $16 million from June 2012 to June 2013.[169] That same year, she was ranked first in the magazine's Top 10 Best Value Stars.[170] In 2015, Forbes published that she had become one of the world's highest-paid actresses with earnings of $6.5 million.[171] The magazine ranked her the world's highest-paid actress two years later with annual earnings of $26 million.[172] In 2017, she was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[173]

Stone has been described as a style icon, with her hair, eyes, and husky voice listed as her trademark features.[161][162] Vogue credits the actress for her "sophisticated, perfectly put-together looks", writing that "her charisma, both on-screen and off-, has charmed many" and for her embrace of "Old Hollywood Glamour".[174][175] Bee Shapiro of The New York Times called Stone a "likable ... spunky, talented, self-deprecating and slightly goofy" actress who is diverse in her fashion choices.[176] In 2009, she was featured on FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World and Maxim's Hot 100;[177][178] the latter also placed her on the list on three other occasions—2010, 2011, and 2014.[179] In 2011, she featured on Victoria's Secret's list of "What is Sexy?" as the Sexiest Actress.[180] She was mentioned in other media outlet listings that year, including People's 100 Most Beautiful Women, each of FHM's and FHM Australia's 100 Sexiest Women in the World, and Men's Health's 100 Hottest Women.[181] She was ranked sixth on Empire's list of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013.[182] Stone was named the best-dressed woman of 2012 by Vogue and was included on similar listings by Glamour in 2013 and 2015, and People in 2014.[183][184]

Personal life

Stone and Andrew Garfield in 2014
Stone moved from Los Angeles to Greenwich Village, New York, in 2009.[15] In 2016, she moved back to Los Angeles.[13] Despite significant media attention, she refuses to publicly discuss her personal life. Concerned with living a normal life, Stone has said she dislikes receiving paparazzi attention outside her home.[185] She has expressed her fondness for her profession,[13] and has cited Diane Keaton as an acting influence, calling her "one of the most covered-up actresses of all time". Stone has a close relationship with her family.[5] She says, "I am blessed with a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense."[177]

Stone dated her Paper Man co-star Kieran Culkin for two years. In 2011, she started dating her Amazing Spider-Man co-star Andrew Garfield for four years.[186][187] Their relationship was reported in the media with various speculations; the pair refused to speak publicly about it, though they made several appearances together. In 2014, on an occasion in New York City, Stone and Garfield encouraged paparazzi to visit websites that spread awareness of causes such as autism.[188] In 2015, they were reported to have broken up.[189][190]

In 2017, Stone began a relationship with Saturday Night Live segment director Dave McCary.[191] They became engaged in December 2019 and married the following year.[192] In January 2021, they were reported to be expecting their first child together.[193] In March 2021, they had their first child, a daughter.[194][195]

Philanthropy
Stone appeared in a Revlon campaign that promoted breast cancer awareness.[199] In 2011, she appeared in a collaborative video between Star Wars and Stand Up to Cancer to raise funds for cancer research.[200] Two years later, she attended an event by Gilda's Club, an organization working for a similar purpose.[201] From 2012 to 2014, she hosted the Entertainment Industry Foundation's Revlon Run/Walk, which helps fight women's cancer.[202]

Stone and three other celebrities were present at the 2012 Nickelodeon HALO Awards, a TV special that profiled four teenagers who are "Helping And Leading Others" (HALO).[203] She attended the 2014 Earth Hour, a worldwide movement for the planet organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature.[204] In 2015, she was part of a fundraising event in support of the Motion Picture & Television Fund, which helps people in the film and television industries with limited or no resources.[205] In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from sexual harassment and discrimination.[206]

Pre-ceremony information
Photo of Jimmy Kimmel in June 2022.
Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 96th Academy Awards, his fourth overall.
On October 17, 2023, Hamish Hamilton was announced as director.[57] On November 15, Jimmy Kimmel was announced as host, returning for the second consecutive year and fourth Academy Awards overall.[4] On November 30, 2023, ABC and the Academy announced that the start time of the ceremony would be moved up by an hour to 4:00 p.m. PT (7:00 p.m. ET).[58] This change enabled ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out, featuring a new episode of its sitcom Abbott Elementary.[58]

The pre-show was hosted for the third consecutive year by Vanessa Hudgens, joined by new co-host Julianne Hough.[59] Due to the scheduling change, the pre-show was shortened to 30 minutes.[58] The beginning of the ceremony was delayed by six minutes, due to arrivals being slowed by Israel–Hamas war protests outside of the theatre.[60][61][62]

On January 29, 2024, comedian and broadcaster Amelia Dimoldenberg, host of the YouTube interview series Chicken Shop Date, was announced as the social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent. Dimoldenberg was involved in multiple Oscar season events, including the Oscars Nominees luncheon, where she participated in an Academy video production with nominees. She was also involved interviewing people at the Oscars red carpet and the "Oscars 96 Behind the Scenes Tour".[63]

Presenters were announced in a series of groups beginning on February 26, 2024.[64][65][66] Performers were announced on February 28, 2024.[67][68] After the first batch of presenters was announced, The Hollywood Reporter learned that the Academy would revive a popular presenting format previously used in 2009,[69] where five Oscar-winning actors for leading and supporting performances took the stage together to introduce the current nominees in their respective categories.[70] David Alan Grier was selected as the event's announcer.[71]

Production designers Alana Billingsley and Misty Buckley designed the stage over the course of nine months. According to Billingsley and Buckley, they were inspired by contemporary spaces where people can "meet, exchange, create [like] a modern-day plaza".[72] Throughout the ceremony, the stage subtly changed its design to honor the nominees; the screenplay categories included images of real typewriters, while the Best Costume Design category showcased images of several of the nominated costumes.[72]

Diversity rules
This was the first year that diversity rules for the Best Picture category became mandatory. In June 2020, under its Academy Aperture 2025 initiative, the academy established a set of "representation and inclusion standards" that a film would be required to satisfy in order to compete in the category.[73] For the last two awards, filmmakers were just required to submit a confidential "Academy Inclusion Standards" form for data purposes only.[74] There are four general standards, of which a film must satisfy two to be considered for Best Picture: (a) "on-screen representation, themes, and narratives"; (b) "creative leadership and project team"; (c) "industry access and opportunities"; and (d) "audience development".[73]

As explained by Alissa Wilkinson of Vox in 2020, the standards "basically break down into two big buckets: standards promoting more inclusive representation and standards promoting more inclusive employment".[74] The standards are intended to provide greater opportunities for employment for "underrepresented" racial and ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ+ people, and persons with "cognitive or physical disabilities".[73]

Box office performance of Best Picture nominees
When the nominations were announced, the films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $1.09 billion at the American and Canadian box offices at the time.[75] Barbie was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees, with $636 million in domestic box office receipts. Oppenheimer came in second with $327 million. The two films, comprising the Barbenheimer phenomenon, represented 88% of the cumulative box office haul generated by Best Picture nominees prior to their nominations.[76] Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing Best Picture winner since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King at the 76th Academy Awards in 2004. It also became the first one to gross more than $100 million at the domestic box office in the decade since Argo at the 85th Academy Awards in 2013.[77]

Ceremony
Messi the Dog from Anatomy of a Fall attended the ceremony and had his own seat in the audience. According to The Hollywood Reporter, multiple companies with nominated films had complained to the Academy about him attending the Oscar nominees luncheon and giving the film an advantage for voting.[78] Before the ceremony, the show's host, Jimmy Kimmel, shared a video in which he could be seen rehearsing his Oscars jokes with Messi. He also made a surprise appearance in the audience of the show and appeared to urinate on Matt Damon's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of the ongoing Damon–Kimmel feud.[79]

Nominees Kaouther Ben Hania, Finneas O'Connell, Billie Eilish, and Mark Ruffalo, as well as presenters Ramy Youssef and Mahershala Ali, wore red Artists4Ceasefire badges calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.[80][81][82][83]

Reception
The ceremony received mostly positive reviews from critics.[84] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 23 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: "Moving at a surprisingly swift clip and peppered with a slate of predictable but agreeable victors, the 96th Oscars' infectious Ken-ergy yields one of the best ceremonies in recent memory."[85] The highlights of the ceremony are considered by many to be the musical performances of "I'm Just Ken" and "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", John Mulaney summarizing the plot of Field of Dreams while presenting the award for Best Sound, an almost nude John Cena presenting Best Costume Design (which Kimmel billed as marking the 50th anniversary of a streaking incident at the 1974 ceremony),[86][87] respective wins of Japanese films Godzilla Minus One and The Boy and the Heron,[88][89][90] and past acting winners introducing this year's nominees.[91][92][93]

The Zone of Interest director Jonathan Glazer received substantial praise and criticism for his Best International Feature acceptance speech, during which he called for the end of Israel's bombardment of Gaza.[94] One sentence from Glazer's speech, in which he said that he and fellow producer James Wilson "stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation", was widely misinterpreted and misquoted, with some sources ending the quote after the words "refute their Jewishness" and incorrectly suggesting that Glazer was disavowing his Jewish identity.[95][96][97] Many pro-Israel figures disapproved of the statement,[98][99] and in the days following the ceremony, over 1,000 Jewish members of the film industry signed an open letter denouncing Glazer's speech and defending the actions of the Israeli government.[100][101] Others defended Glazer's comments, including writer Tony Kushner[102] and the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, where The Zone of Interest is set and where parts of it were filmed.[103]

Conversely, the In Memoriam section received criticism for being too distracting and the names and faces being so tiny and distant much of the time that it was difficult recognizing them.[104][105][106] The Best Picture presentation by Al Pacino was criticized for not naming the 10 nominees before announcing the winner.[107][108][109] Clips from the Best Picture nominees had been shown over the course of the ceremony, and producer Molly McNearney said to Variety that the reading of the nominees was cut "because we were very worried that the show was going to be long". Similarly, the nominees for Best Original Song were also not read aloud when handed out by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, as each of the songs had been performed earlier in the evening.[110] Acknowledging that it was not his decision, Pacino later apologized for not listing the nominees, saying that "to not be fully recognized is offensive and hurtful."[111]

Ratings
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 19.5 million people over its length, which was a 4% increase from the previous year's ceremony and marking the longest streak of annual ratings increases for the Academy Awards since 2014.[112] However, the show slipped a little in 18–49 demo rating with a 3.81 rating among viewers in that key demographic, down 5% from 4.03 rating of last year's ceremony.[113] The viewership peaked in the last half-hour with 21.9 million total viewers.[114] The ceremony scored the biggest audience for any awards show since the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020, and is so far the largest viewership for any live non-sports entertainment program on U.S. television in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.[9] ABC's Abbott Elementary lead-out also benefitted, with the episode reaching a series high in the 18–49 demo (1.42 rating) and total viewership (6.9 million).[115][58]
Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller film[a] written, directed, and co-produced by Christopher Nolan.[8] It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory, and his fall from grace after his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.

Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule.[9] Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.

Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over US$964 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.

Among its many accolades, Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Murphy, and Best Supporting Actor for Downey. It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.

Plot
In 1926, the 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in the University of Cambridge. Upset with Blackett's attitude, Oppenheimer leaves him an apple poisoned with cyanide but later retrieves it. The visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen instead.

Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets the scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the US, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine "Kitty" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist psychiatrist who later dies by suicide.

When nuclear fission is discovered in 1938 after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it could be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, US Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis.

Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that would ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.

After Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his guilt to Truman, the president berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development.

As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioisotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonated their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.

In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance during which his loyalty to America is questioned. However, the hearing is a show trial. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty delivers impassioned testimony in defense of herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.

In 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is voted down, with the junior Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy casting the deciding vote. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation.

A flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Instead, the two discussed Oppenheimer’s legacy, and Oppenheimer expressed his fear that they had indeed started a chain reaction, a nuclear arms race, that will one day destroy the world. As Einstein leaves, the remorseful Oppenheimer imagines the world consumed by nuclear fire, and closes his eyes in despair.

Production
Development

Kai Bird (pictured) and Martin J. Sherwin are the authors of J. Robert Oppenheimer's biography American Prometheus (2005), on which the film is based.
The director Sam Mendes was interested in adapting the 2005 Oppenheimer biography American Prometheus (2005) by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. After that project failed to materialize, the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the next fifteen years. The authors became pessimistic about a film adaptation. Oliver Stone declined an opportunity to direct, saying he "couldn't find my way to its essence".[54][55] In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.[55]

Nolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading American Prometheus.[56] In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave him a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed Oppenheimer "wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done". Nolan wanted to depict "what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments", in contrast to Tenet, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.[57][2]

In December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with Warner Bros. on each of his films since Insomnia (2002), was outraged, as he was a staunch supporter of traditional film exhibition.[58] In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros.[59] By mid-2021, Nolan had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project.[2] Nolan had previously supported Warner's decision to give Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) a simultaneous release, saying he felt that situation had been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of Tenet.[60][61]

In September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film about Oppenheimer and his contributions to the Manhattan Project, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.[62][63] Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple.[64][65] According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process due to the replacement of the CEO and chairman, Jim Gianopulos, with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.[65]

Nolan signed with Universal because he had previously worked with Donna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television series The Prisoner.[66] Langley agreed with Nolan's stance on traditional film exhibition and Universal agreed to finance and distribute Oppenheimer, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022.[67] Universal also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million,[68] an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the opening, in which Universal could not release another new film.[65][2]

Writing
Nolan became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric "How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?" in the Sting song "Russians" (1985).[69] He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that "while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[57] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[56] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as "emotional" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had "Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller".[70]

By September 2021, both Roven and Nolan had begun contacting Bird and Sherwin to discuss the script. During Bird's first meeting with Nolan, he had already written a spec script while they discussed the script's content, although Nolan did not disclose the script to them yet.[71] Oppenheimer is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the "texture" of the film being "how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale.[56][72][73] He began developing the script after he completed Tenet and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.[56]

A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not "necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment".[69] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[74] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a "more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view".[75][69] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[76] Nolan noted that while Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he still believed Oppenheimer had felt genuine guilt for his actions and thus portrayed him as exhibiting those feelings.[77]

I think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I've made three Batman films, is saying a lot.

— Christopher Nolan, Total Film[70]

Nolan began by trying to find the "thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.[57] As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had "enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate".[78] Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in Amadeus (1984).[69]

Another critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a "crybaby". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a "massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with", while also underscoring that it is a "huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception".[56] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the "highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible".[73] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to present a "strong set of troubling reverberations at the end".[77]

Casting
Oppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy read extensively on Oppenheimer's life and was inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[79][10][69] Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room.[80] Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance.[81] Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014).[56] As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.[56]

The casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on.[37] Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4 million in lieu of their usual $10–20 million upfront salary.[82] Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper.[83] Downey would later describe Oppenheimer as "the best film" in which he has appeared to date.[84] Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine "Kitty" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.[83] Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon—who had appeared in Nolan's Interstellar—was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to Oppenheimer as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film.[85] Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in Licorice Pizza (2021).[86] Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.[69] It is Nolan's first film since Insomnia (2002) to not feature Michael Caine.[87]

Filming


Filming took place at the University of California, Berkeley, in May 2022.
Pre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists.[88][89] Another casting call was held in February.[90]

Principal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico,[91] and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer.[81][24] The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for filming.[92] However, during pre-production, it had become clear that principal photography could not be completed within $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States.[92] To efficiently use the budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and constructing high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule from 85 to 57 days.[92][93] Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as "insane".[92]

Gary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for "one scene, a page and a half".[52] The original choice for Oval Office location in the Nixon Presidential Library fell through a week before filming, and since Oldman's dates were unmovable, the production design team redressed the Oval Office set from Veep, which according to Ruth De Jong had fallen into "nightmarish" disrepair.[94] Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show "that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you".[57]

The film used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film.[10] It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film.[95][96] Van Hoytema used 50 mm and 80 mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses.[97] Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography and microphotography to record the miniature effects.[98] In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[99] Filming also occurred in California,[51] primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.[100] Scenes set in the city of Berkeley itself were filmed in Pasadena.[101]

During a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks.[91] Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch.[91] It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days.[91] The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos.[101] Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022.[91] Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos.[91] Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance.[102] The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque's Old Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.[101]

Filming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics.[103] When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb.[2] Nolan later remarked that it was both "flattering" and "scary" that his fans would think that of him.[2] The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][101] The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][101] A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[57] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the special effects supervisor, Scott R. Fisher, referred to them as "big-atures", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective.[104][105] Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects,[106] and used practical effects to achieve "real-world imagery".[107] Filming wrapped in May 2022.[108]

Post-production
Editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited Tenet.[10] While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed "character passes" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters.[69] Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements,[109] marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor,[110] who stated that the film used mostly "invisible" visual effects through "'in-camera' special effects created on set".[111] Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.[112]

Steven Spielberg was the first person to see the final cut, in a private screening of its first 70mm print. Nolan said: "He said some very kind things, but really just to watch him watch ... I wasn't even supposed to watch it with him, but seeing the great master watching? It was sort of irresistible."[113][114]

Music
Main article: Oppenheimer (soundtrack)

Ludwig Göransson won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.
Ludwig Göransson composed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan's previous film, Tenet.[10] Göransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023.[115] It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.[116][117] Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from "the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds".[69]

Release
Marketing
Oppenheimer's teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29 a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of Nope before being posted online on Universal's social media profiles.[118] Empire commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: "heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight".[119] In December 2022, two trailers premiered in front of Avatar: The Way of Water, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online.[120][121] In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.[122]

Theatrical release

Le Grand Rex in Paris, where Oppenheimer held its world premiere
Oppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023,[123] followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[124] and the American premiere at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City on July 17.[125] Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[124] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere.[125] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios "duped" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like Oppenheimer.[126] Oppenheimer was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[10][127] In addition to standard digital cinemas, it was also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[128]

The film was released on the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was made in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[129] Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences,[130] and how they should be viewed as a double feature.[131] The trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer",[132] and was labeled as counterprogramming during a summer of "entertainment industry meltdown".[133] Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying "My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain."[134]

In March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[135] Oppenheimer had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of "preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values".[136]

The film remained unreleased in Japan for numerous months following its initial global release. Variety noted the controversial reputation in Japan due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A Universal spokesperson said that "plans have not been finalized in all markets". American films are often released in Japan a few months after the initial theatrical release.[137] In December 2023, the independent Japanese film distributor Bitters End announced that it would theatrically release the film by 2024, as Universal's distributor in Japan Toho-Towa opted not to release it.[138][139] On January 24, 2024, Bitters End confirmed that the film is set to be released in Japan on March 29.[140]

Classifications and censorship
In the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for "some sexuality, nudity, and language". It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since Insomnia (2002).[141] In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for "strong sex and a suicide scene".[142] In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for "strong language and sex", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film.[143] In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.[144][145][146]

In India, Oppenheimer was released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time.[147] The audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, "I am become Death, destroyer of worlds", remained intact.[148] As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.[149] Hindu nationalists were angered by the scene and demanded its removal.[150] Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a "direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus", and demanded its removal from all releases of Oppenheimer across the world.[148] On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj told The Times of India that "The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act."[151]

Home media
Oppenheimer was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray and DVD formats including digital on November 21, 2023.[152] As the former two releases sold out days after release, Universal worked on restocking before the holiday season.[153] Nolan was vocal during the home release campaign of the film about the importance of physical media libraries, stating that letting films only exist digitally or on streaming services allows companies to have too much control and creates a danger for film preservation.[154][155] The film was released for streaming in the US exclusively on Peacock and in Canada on Amazon Prime Video on February 16, 2024.[156][157] Additionally, it will start streaming on Jio Cinema in India from March 21, 2024.[158]

Reception
Box office
As of March 22, 2024, Oppenheimer has grossed $329.9 million in the United States and Canada and $635 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $964.9 million.[3][4] It is the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time behind Joker (2019).[159][160] In September 2023, Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassing Bohemian Rhapsody (2018).[161][162]

By August 2023, Oppenheimer had become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, although in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassing Barbie for the first time.[163] It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing Dunkirk (2017), also a Nolan film.[164][165] Additionally, Oppenheimer became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million[166] (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70 mm prints.[167] The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theaters on November 3, including six IMAX 70 mm prints, as these theaters reported selling out during the initial release.[166]

United States and Canada
In the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer was released alongside Barbie,[168] in what became known as 'Barbenheimer'. The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day.[169] After grossing $33 million on its first day (including $10.5 million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million,[170] finishing second behind Barbie and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama.[171] 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18–34 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for Oppenheimer), a combined total of 18.5 million people.[172] The opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from The Dark Knight trilogy.[173] It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind The Passion of the Christ (2004) and American Sniper (2014).[174]

Oppenheimer made $46.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind Barbie.[175][176] The film made $28.7 million in its third weekend, finishing third behind Barbie and newcomer Meg 2: The Trench.[177] On August 16, Oppenheimer surpassed Sing (2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.[178][179] During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place.[180] In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend.[180] Following its 13 Oscar nominations, the film expanded from 1,008 theaters to 2,262 in its 28th week of release and made $1 million, an increase of 284% from the previous weekend.[181][182]

Other territories
Outside the United States and Canada, the film grossed $98 million in its opening weekend.[183] The following weekend, Oppenheimer earned $77.1 million, dropping by just 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey.[184] In its third weekend, Oppenheimer grossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%)[185] and $32 million in its fourth weekend.[186] The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[187][188] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($75 million), China ($61.6 million), Germany ($51.9 million), France ($43.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[189] In Japan, the film, which was, during months of controversy, said to underplay the actual effects of the bomb, [190] will be released on March 29, 2024.[191]

Critical response
The film received widespread critical acclaim.[b] Critics praised Oppenheimer primarily for its screenplay, cast performances, and visuals.[c] It was frequently ranked as one of Nolan's best films,[206][207][198] and one of the best of 2023. Hindustan Times reported that the film was hailed as one of the best of the 21st century.[208] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 501 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Oppenheimer marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals."[209] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[210] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[172]

Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four, describing it as "magnificent" and "one of the best films of the 21st century".[211] The A.V. Club's Matthew Jackson deemed it a "masterpiece", adding that "it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers and a movie that burns itself into your brain".[212] Empire's Dan Jolin labeled it a "masterfully constructed character study", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography.[213] Peter Suderman writing for Reason magazine said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of "fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great and terrible. Oppenheimer isn't just a movie—it's a warning."[214]

Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com awarded Oppenheimer a full four out of four rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character and its technical achievements, concluding: "As a physical experience, Oppenheimer is something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what and that's what's so fascinating about it".[215] Peter Travers described the film as a "monumental achievement" and "one of the best films you'll see anywhere".[216] Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it "boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet", adding that it combined the "explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy" with the "cerebral underpinnings" of Memento, Inception and Tenet.[217] IGN critic Siddhant Adlakha ranked Oppenheimer 10/10, describing it as "a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller" and Nolan's most "abstract" work yet.[218]

Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film four and a half out of five and stated: "Oppenheimer, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition".[219] In August 2023, it ranked number three on Collider's list of "The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far," writing that Nolan "explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante [sic] as an inspiration, Oppenheimer makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again."[220]

Despite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that "Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment".[221][222] While praising how the film acknowledges the contribution of "American scientists and American enterprise", Brett Mason complained that it omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans who ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: "Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest."[223] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying "representational completists" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, "Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence".[192] According to Richard Brody, the movie-listings editor at The New Yorker who described the film "History Channel movie with fancy editing", "I was tempted to call it a movie-length Wikipedia article. But after a look online, I realized I was giving Wikipedia too little credit—or Christopher Nolan, the movie's writer and director, too much".[224]

For IndieWire's annual critics poll, in which 158 critics and journalists from around the world voted, Oppenheimer was placed second in their Best Film list, with 69 overall mentions and 17 first-place votes. Nolan was also ranked second on the Best Director list, while his screenplay was placed eighth. Murphy was the highest-placed actor on the Best Performance list (fourth overall) while Van Hoytema's work topped the Best Cinematography list.[225] Oppenheimer also appeared in over 410 critics' lists of the best films released in 2023, and was ranked first in 99 of them.[226]

Response by filmmakers
Oliver Stone deemed the film "a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate".[227] Paul Schrader called Oppenheimer, "the best, most important film of this century",[228] while Denis Villeneuve called it "a masterpiece".[229] Steven Soderbergh said of the film, "Oppenheimer is a real accomplishment. I read somewhere that Chris [Nolan] implied that this is the movie he's been building toward, and I think he's right. And I'm thrilled that it's a massive hit."[230] While Japanese director Takashi Yamazaki said, “As a person of Japanese ancestry and descent, my response to ‘Oppenheimer’ [is that] I would like to dedicate a different film to that when that day comes.”[231]

Accuracy and omissions

While President Truman did have a portrait of Argentine leader José de San Martín, it did not arrive at the White House until October 29, 1946, more than a year after Truman's meeting with Oppenheimer.[232][233]
The film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.[234] Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film since he did not know how significant it would become. The study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a "crybaby" but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.[234][235]

It was also pointed out that the incorrect American flag was used. In the film, the current 50-star flag is shown. This version was not adopted until 1960. During the war, the American flag had only 48 stars as Hawaii and Alaska had yet to become states.[236]

The scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor's apple is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life.[237] Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day and narrowly preventing it from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple or had any involvement in the incident.[234] Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends,[238] but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened.[234] Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to physicist Arthur Compton at the Metallurgical Laboratory, not Einstein.[234] Compton was also the first to appoint Oppenheimer to take over the research into the bomb-design part of the Manhattan Project.[239]

In addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence as a possible constraint upon the nuclear arms race between the US and USSR as a "broader tragedy" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy but he called the production "highly accurate" otherwise for a Hollywood film.[240]

Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites like Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown.[235] Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on producing the radioactive material that powered the nuclear explosions.[241] In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.[242]

According to Kate Gardner,

The one glaring omission from the film is in fact 19,000 omissions – the number of people, mostly Indigenous, who lived near the Trinity test site in New Mexico. Oppenheimer implies the area was empty, side-stepping the thorny truth that local residents were not warned about the test at all – not even given a false story to prevent them from drinking the toxic rainwater that fell for the next few days.[243]

Influence
The renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing encouraged the United States Congress to revise the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during the Cold War, known as "Downwinders" and primarily consisting of the Navajo Nation. The United States Senate approved amendments to accommodate additional services to people in New Mexico, but it has not passed through Congress as the House of Representatives had not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 fiscal year.[244]

Dune: Part Two is a 2024 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. The sequel to Dune (2021), it is the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel Dune by Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides as he unites with the Fremen people of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Zendaya, Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film, with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, Léa Seydoux, and Souheila Yacoub joining the ensemble cast.

Development began after Legendary Entertainment acquired film and television rights for the Dune franchise in 2016. Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. Production contracts were only secured for the first film, with the second film having to be green-lit based on the first's success. Villeneuve was concerned about the sequel's certainty after the first film had a simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release but Warner Bros. Pictures assured him the sequel would happen if it performed well on HBO Max. After the critical and commercial success of the first film, Warner Bros. and Legendary green-lit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. Principal photography took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan and Abu Dhabi between July and December 2022.

Dune: Part Two was scheduled for a November 2023 release, but was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. The film had its world premiere at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and opened in the United States on March 1. It received praise from critics and has grossed over $574 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024.

Plot
Following the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.

Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that she must replace her by drinking the Water of Life — a fatal poison for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid also accelerates the cognitive development of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to telepathically communicate with her. Jessica and Alia agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Jessica urges Paul also to drink the Water of Life and become the Kwisatz Haderach. Chani and her friend Shishakli believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.

Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul embraces the Fremen ways: learning their language, taking part in rites such as riding a sandworm, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, and helping raid Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names "Usul" and "Muad'Dib." Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew Rabban as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic younger nephew and heir apparent Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to seduce him to secure his genetic lineage.

Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays north, fearful that his visions of a holy war will come true if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen — including Sietch Tabr — forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south. Shishakli remains behind and is killed by Feyd-Rautha. Arriving south, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. Chani is angered by this but is forced by Jessica to revive him by mixing her tears with the liquid. Paul attains a clearer vision of the past, present, and future, seeing an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and discovering Jessica is the Baron's daughter, making Paul both an Atreides and a Harkonnen.

The southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar for leadership, but he refuses and instead galvanizes the fundamentalists by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Emperor Shaddam. Gaius Helen Mohiam tells Irulan that she advised the Emperor to annihilate House Atreides as they had grown too defiant. Shaddam arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As he meets the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch a massive military strike using atomics and sandworms. They overpower the Sardaukar, while Paul kills the Baron and takes Shaddam and his entourage captive. Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.

To Chani's dismay, Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne, demanding Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement in House Atreides' destruction. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Shaddam chooses Feyd-Rautha as his champion, and Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring. The Great Houses above Arrakis reject Paul's ascendancy, so Paul orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia see this as the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm.

Production
Development

Denis Villeneuve returned to direct and co-write Dune: Part Two.
By November 2016, Legendary Pictures had obtained the film and TV rights for the Dune franchise, based on the eponymous 1965 novel by Frank Herbert.[11] Vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Mary Parent began discussing with Denis Villeneuve about directing a film adaptation, quickly hiring him after realizing his passion for Dune.[12] By February 2018, Villeneuve was confirmed to be hired as director, and intended to adapt the novel as a two-part film series.[13][14] Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaption of Stephen King's It in 2017 and 2019.[15] In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed to be serving as the film's editor.[16] Other crew included Brad Riker as supervising art director, Patrice Vermette as production designer, Paul Lambert as visual effects supervisor, Gerd Nefzer as special effects supervisor, and Thomas Struthers as stunt coordinator.[17] Dune: Part Two was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant.[18] Legendary CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel, adding that "there's a logical place to stop the [first] movie before the book is over".[19]

In December 2020, Villeneuve stated that due to Warner Bros.' plan to release the film in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously, the first film could underperform financially, resulting in cancellation of the planned sequel.[20] In an IMAX screening of the first film's first ten minutes, the title logo read Dune: Part One, lending credence to plans for the sequel.[21] By August 2021, Villeneuve spoke more confidently about the chances of a sequel film, iterating his excitement to work with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya again,[22] while stating Chani would have a bigger role in the sequel.[23] Warner Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel would be greenlit as long as the film performed well on HBO Max.[24] Just days prior to the first film's release, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, "Will we have a sequel to Dune? If you watch the movie you see how it ends. I think you pretty much know the answer to that."[25]

On October 26, 2021, Legendary officially greenlit Dune: Part Two, with a spokesperson for the company stating, "We would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Here's to more Dune."[26] Production work had occurred back-to-back with the first film, as Villeneuve and his wife Lapointe immediately took a flight to Budapest in order to begin pre-production work.[27] A key point of negotiation prior to greenlighting the sequel was assuring that the sequel would have an exclusive window where it would only be shown theatrically, with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window before it would be available through other channels. Villeneuve said this theatrical exclusivity was a "non-negotiable condition", and that "the theatrical experience is at the very heart of the cinematic language for me."[28] With Dune: Part Two being greenlit, Villeneuve said that his primary concern was to complete the filming as soon as possible, with the earliest he expected to start in the last quarter of 2022. However, he noted that production would be expedited by the work already done for the first film.[28]

Writing



(Left to right) Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson returned as Paul Atreides, Chani, and Lady Jessica, respectively.
Eric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in April 2017 for the Dune films,[29] and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve.[30] Game of Thrones language creator David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film in April 2019.[31] Villeneuve and Peterson had created the Chakobsa language, which was used by actors on set.[32] In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as show-runner for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune: Part Two.[33] In June 2020, Greig Fraser said, "It's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. It's a fully standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see it".[34] Between the release of Dune and the confirmation of Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve started working the script in a way that production could begin immediately once the film was greenlit.[35] By February 2021, Roth created a full treatment for the sequel,[36] with writing beginning that August.[37] He confirmed that Feyd-Rautha would appear in the film, and stated he will be a "very important character".[38] In March 2022, Villeneuve had mostly finished writing the screenplay.[39] Craig Mazin and Roth wrote additional literary material for the film.[40]

Villeneuve stated that the film would continue directly from the first, and specifically described it as being the "second part."[41] He described the film as being an "epic war movie", adding that while the first film was more "contemplative", the second would feature more action.[42] Villeneuve sought to anchor the movie to the characters, primarily Paul and Chani. With the two featured in an "epic love story" between them, Villeneuve described them as the "epicenter of the story". Zendaya initially found difficulty in creating dialogue, commenting that "It was funny trying to figure out in this futuristic space talk, like, how do they flirt?" Chalamet also added that Paul would be heavily influenced by Chani, serving as his "moral compass". Additionally, Paul becomes deeply embedded in Fremen culture, developing a closer bond with Stilgar, who becomes his surrogate father figure and mentor, while tensions emerge between Chani and Lady Jessica, as Chani is aware that Jessica's schemes negatively impact the Fremen.[41] The script ultimately conveys Chani as a nonbeliever of the prophecy and intended for its structure to first convey their romantic relationship from Paul's perspective, and eventually pivot to Chani's perspective as the audience realizes Paul's desire for power and insidious nature.[43] He focused on Herbert's original intention to depict Paul as an antihero in Dune to becoming an eventual villain, and wrote the script with that in mind while also considering his future plans regarding Dune Messiah, particularly by modifying Chani's characterization as he felt that she eventually "disappeared in Paul's shadows" in the book.[44][45] Feeling he had the "benefit of time" in doing so, Villeneuve decided to use all the elements of Paul's character arc and "play them a bit differently" in order to establish his eventual transformation into a villainous figure and becoming "what he was trying to fight against".[43] He expanded the role of Chani and Lady Jessica from the novel, and interpreted Chani as being a critique of power.[32] When envisioning the sandworm sequence, Villeneuve primarily relied upon his own drawings and storyboards, as he felt the book did not contain adequate descriptions. He later cited it as being one of his favorite scenes in the film.[46] When writing Paul's character arc, he considered Paul as transforming from a "humble" figure to a "dark messianic figure", and took inspiration from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira (1988) when designing the storyboards.[47] Villeneuve felt the film's ending was more "tragic" than that of the book, feeling that it adequately resolved Paul's storyline across the Dune films while setting up his character arc for a potential third film based on Dune Messiah (1969).[48]

Following the first film, Baron Harkonnen is described as being heavily debilitated and reliant on being submerged in fluids, while focusing on choosing an heir: Glossu Rabban or Feyd-Rautha, both his nephews. Rabban was regarded as being a bad strategist, while Feyd-Rautha is shown to be clever and charismatic.[41] Actor Austin Butler felt Feyd-Rautha's character served as "flip sides of the same coin" to Paul, as both had been involved in the Bene Gesserit's genetic breeding program; Butler opined Feyd-Rautha's upbringing on Giedi Prime and self-care for his body explained his arrogance. Meanwhile, Villeneuve noted his psychopathic personality and brutality similar to that of an animal contrasted his "code of honors" and reverence for fighters.[49] Lady Jessica is also heavily traumatized by the death of Duke Leto, being compared to Paul as a "survivor" and strategizing to realize the ambitions of the Bene Gesserit, who aim to fulfill their prophecy to maximize human potential, disregarding morality and ethics. There is also additional focus on the political aspect, with Princess Irulan fearing that her father, Emperor Shaddam IV, will lose his throne due to his loss of influence over warring factions.[41] During the sequence of Paul's consumption of the Water of Life, Villeneuve deliberately altered the timeframe to depict an adult Alia for a dramatic effect and to highlight Alia's unique birth. He and Spaihts decided to "compress" the time for both the sequence and Lady Jessica's pregnancy in order to establish more narrative tension. He also added that Lady Jessica's conversations with an embryonic Alia was unique as he felt it was "fresh and original to have a character who is powerful and still a pregnant woman" while also conveying how others perceive Alia as an "abomination".[7] Like Chani and Lady Jessica, Villeneuve further developed Princess Irulan's character and motivations from the novel, with actress Florence Pugh noting her reserved nature and intelligence.[32]

Casting



(Left to right) Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and Christopher Walken joined the cast as Feyd-Rautha, Princess Irulan, and Shaddam IV, respectively.
In March 2022, Pugh and Butler were reported to be in talks to star in the film as Princess Irulan and Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha, respectively.[50][51] Butler was offered the role while having coffee with Villeneuve, without needing to audition. He trained for four months in Budapest, using a fitness regimen made by an ex-Navy SEALs member.[52][49] Villeneuve described his performance as being a "cross between a psychopath killer, an Olympic sword master, a snake, and Mick Jagger" while Butler researched past cultures he felt "bred brutality" and took inspiration from various animals including sharks and snakes.[53][54] Butler also said that he drew inspiration from Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger for his performance.[55] He imitated Skarsgård's voice as the Baron, as he felt that Feyd would be influenced by the Baron due to growing up with him.[15] In May, Christopher Walken joined the cast as Shaddam IV.[56] In June, Léa Seydoux entered negotiations to join the cast as Lady Margot Fenring.[57] In July, Souheila Yacoub joined the cast as Shishakli.[58] In January 2023, Tim Blake Nelson was added to the cast in an undisclosed role.[9] Attending the film's London premiere in February 2024, Anya Taylor-Joy confirmed that she had been cast in the film.[59] Villeneuve was surprised that her role had been kept a secret for that long, noting it required "so much work to keep that secret". Her role had been revealed in a casting credit list for the film on Letterboxd.[60]

Filming
Pre-shooting had commenced on July 4, 2022, at the Brion tomb in Altivole, Italy for two days.[61] Principal photography was set to begin on July 21 in Budapest, Hungary,[61] but began earlier on July 18.[8][62] The film was entirely shot using Arri Alexa LF digital cameras, with new filming locations and sets being used "to avoid repetition."[63] By October 2022, Chalamet had taken a break from filming in order to attend the premiere of Bones and All (2022).[64] By the next month, production moved to Abu Dhabi, with Pugh also finishing her scenes in the same month.[65][66] Certain scenes set at dawn had to be filmed across three days to take advantage of the golden hour.[67] A special unit of production filmed scenes with Taylor-Joy in Namibia, the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa.[68] Filming wrapped on December 12, 2022.[69] Due to the delays, Villeneuve was able to make a film transfer for projection using the IMAX 70 mm and conventional 70 mm film formats.[35]

Pugh delivered Princess Irulan's opening narration during her first day of filming and for overall production.[70] Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser had filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator sequence with specially designed black-and-white infrared cameras. They wanted the Harkonnens to cheer and stomp rather than applaud, and designed over 30 sections for spectators in the arena.[71] Butler spent his first week on set filming the scene, during which the set had very high temperatures that caused some people to faint.[72] He also improvised his kiss scene with the Baron.[73] For romantic scenes between Paul and Chani, the scenes primarily filmed in remote locations in Jordan during the golden hour. The scenes were often filmed as quickly as possible, with only a one-hour window being available.[41] The scene of Paul's sandworm ride was filmed practically on a production unit separate from the main one, being led by producer Tanya Lapointe and a special team. Chalamet filmed his scenes on a platform meant to imitate a portion of the sandworm, with gripping devices serving as the reference for the Fremen hooks. An industrial fan blew sand on set to emulate the desert climate.[74] Chalamet estimated the scene took over three months to film, with individual shoots occurring over a span of 20-30 minutes. As the actual sandworm was not built and there were no reference shots, the production team designed a small portion of the worm on set and the actors had to physically visualize and imitate riding the sandworm.[75][76] Butler and Chalamet had separately trained with a Kali instructor in Los Angeles for the climactic battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. They were excited to do the scene, and immediately began practicing once they later met in Budapest. They performed the scene by themselves, including for wide camera shots, while Chalamet delivers the monologue entirely in Chakobsa.[77][78] Ferguson had cited Lady Jessica undergoing the Reverend Mother process as her favorite scene, working with contortionists for the scene and comparing it to an Exorcist film.[79]

Music
Main article: Dune: Part Two (soundtrack)

Hans Zimmer returned to compose the score of Dune: Part Two.
Hans Zimmer returned to compose the film's score after doing so for the previous film.[80] Zimmer had composed over 90 minutes of music prior to the announcement of the film to help give Villeneuve inspiration when writing.[81] Two singles were released on February 15, 2024, by WaterTower Music, titled "A Time of Quiet Between the Storms" and "Harvester Attack". The full soundtrack album was released on February 23.[82]

Marketing
A teaser trailer for Dune: Part Two was presented during the Warner Bros. panel at CinemaCon on April 27, 2023.[63][42] First-look footage of the cast in-character were released online, alongside a teaser poster, on May 2, 2023.[83] The trailer was released to the public the following day.[84] Variety called it "breathtaking";[85] GQ hailed the shots of Paul riding a sandworm as "the standout sequence";[86] and Fangoria remarked "If you're not excited for this one, we dunno what to tell you".[87] Chalamet and Zendaya later discussed and promoted the film at a Warner Bros. presentation at CineEurope on June 21.[88]

A second trailer was released on June 29, 2023.[89] Chris Evangelista of Film was excited about the appearance of Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.[90] Ben Travis of Empire praised the "seismic" and "astounding, none-more-eye-boggling" imagery, feeling the scope to be "particularly expansive" and noted the monochromatic footage depicting Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha while calling the footage of Christopher Walken's appearance "impactful".[91] Joshua Rivera of Polygon opined "The trailer, simply put, rocks" and enjoyed the footage present.[92]

The film was promoted during the December 2023 CCXP with Chalamet, Zendaya, Pugh, Butler, and Villeneuve, where over 10 minutes of footage was released.[93] Additional footage from Dune: Part Two was shown during a limited IMAX theatrical re-release of Christopher Nolan's Tenet (2020), as part of Warner Bros.' celebration for the former film's release.[94][95]

In January 2024, images of a forthcoming Dune-themed popcorn bucket from AMC Theatres went viral and became an Internet meme due to comparisons of its sandworm design to an artificial vagina.[96][97][98] Saturday Night Live featured a musical sketch with Marcello Hernandez, Ayo Edebiri, Devon Walker, and Bowen Yang parodying the phenomenon.[99]

Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures partnered with Xbox to provide an immersive content suite related to the film, and visual designs inspired by the film being featured on a floating controller, Xbox Series X, and a console holder. Microsoft Flight Simulator also included an expansion pack allowing players to explore Arrakis and pilot the Royal Atreides Ornithopter.[100] In November 2023, the Sardaukar were added to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) in a collaboration pack.[101] A month later, Paul and Feyd-Rautha were added as playable operators to its sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023), with an additional Harkonnen soldier skin being announced in March 2024.[102][103] In September 2023, McFarlane Toys announced a new line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the sequel film.[104] Legendary Comics will release Dune: Part Two - The Official Movie Graphic Novel with the help of Kickstarter in the same way the previous adaptation was published.[105]

Release
Dune: Part Two was originally scheduled to be released on October 20, 2023,[106] but was delayed to November 17, 2023,[107] before moving forward two weeks to November 3, 2023, to adjust to changes in release schedules from other studios.[108] It was later postponed by over four months to March 15, 2024, due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes.[109] After the strikes were resolved, the film moved once more up two weeks to March 1, 2024.[110]

Following the success of Oppenheimer (2023) in the format, Dune: Part Two was released in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm format to twelve venues worldwide,[111] and in standard 5-perforation 70mm format to 38 venues worldwide. [112]

A red carpet event was hosted in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on February 6, 2024.[113] Dune: Part Two's world premiere was held at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on February 15.[114][115]

On January 16, 2024, the film was shown to a dying man in a palliative care home in the Canadian city of Saguenay, in Denis Villeneuve's native province of Quebec.[116][117] The man had expressed a wish to see Dune: Part Two before his death. Josée Gagnon, the cofounder of a company aiming to accompany people at the end of life, relayed his wish to Villeneuve and Tanya Lapointe, his partner and one of the film's producers, through a viral call-out on Facebook. According to Gagnon, Villeneuve and Lapointe "were very touched. They were saying that this is why they make cinema. For the guy who wants to see a film before he dies. It's like a consecration".[118] The pair initially offered to invite the man to see Dune: Part Two in Los Angeles or Montreal, but since he was too weak to travel, Villeneuve eventually decided to send one of his assistants directly to Saguenay with his private laptop.[116][118] The film was screened in a room of the care facility, where everyone was required to hand in their cellphones and sign waivers.[118] The man was in too much pain, however, to watch it entirely and had to stop halfway through.[117] The man eventually passed away on January 25.[119] The incident, which CBC referred to as the actual "world premiere" of the film, was publicly disclosed after its theatrical release.[120][116]

Reception
Box office
As of March 24, 2024, Dune: Part Two has grossed $233.4 million in the United States and Canada and $341 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $574.4 million.[3][4] The Hollywood Reporter estimated the film needed to gross around $500 million in order to break-even.[121]

In the United States and Canada, the film's advanced ticket sales surpassed those of Oppenheimer, and it was projected to gross $65–80 million from 4,050 theaters in its opening weekend. It was also expected to gross $85–90 million from 71 international markets, for a worldwide debut of around $170 million.[122] The film made $32.2 million on its first day, including $12 million from previews on February 25 and 29; IMAX screenings made up $4.5 million (38%) of the early totals.[123] It went on to debut to $82.5 million,[124] doubling the first film's $41 million opening weekend; IMAX screenings made up $18.5 million (23%) of the total, a record for a March release.[123][125] According to Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros.,[126] it was "much higher than any of us could predict," especially for "a genre that is a hard nut to crack."[127] The film also made $100.02 million from 72 international markets in its opening weekend, bringing its worldwide three-day debut to $182.5 million.[128] In its second weekend the film made $46 million (a 44% drop), finishing second behind newcomer Kung Fu Panda 4. It also surpassed the entire domestic gross of the first film ($108 million) in just seven days.[129] The film made $28.5 million in its third weekend, remaining in second.[130]

Critical response
Dune: Part Two received acclaim from critics and was praised for its visual effects and cast performances.[131][132][133] Some reviews considered it one of the best science fiction films ever.[134][135] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 402 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Visually thrilling and narratively epic, Dune: Part Two continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form."[136] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[137] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 94% overall positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend it.[123]

The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded the film four stars out of five and praised its visuals: "Dune's loose-endedness is one of its best qualities: finding out what happens is secondary to just seeing it unfold."[138] Peter Bradshaw, chief film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film four stars out of five, writing "Denis Villeneuve's monumental adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It's impossible to imagine anyone doing it better."[139] Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three stars out of four, praising the technical and narrative aspects, saying, "Even as we marvel at the stunning and immersive and Oscar-level cinematography, editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two, we're reminded at every turn that this is an absolutely bat-bleep [sic] crazy story."[140]

Other reviews were more mixed in their judgement. In The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarkye praised the film's technical aspects and performances, but found it failed to fully adapt the book's nuance on themes such as imperialism.[141] Nicholas Barber wrote for the BBC that the film is "one of the most jaw-droppingly weird pieces of art-house psychedelia ever to come from a major studio", finding the film's grand scale made up for its issues.[142] At the more negative end, Noah Berlatsky writing for CNN judged that the film had failed to "present an effective anti-colonial vision" by still being centred around Paul's destiny despite an increased voice of opposition from Chani.[143]

Furvah Shah, writing for Cosmopolitan UK, said she "felt frustrated as a Muslim viewer", criticising the film for a lack of Middle East and North African (MENA) casting amongst the leads despite the use of the region's culture and superficial use of Islam.[144] The New Arab's Hannah Flint also criticized the use of Arab and Islamic cultural items and lack of MENA casting, though did praise that of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souheila Yacoub as a "win for Arab representation".[145] Steven D. Greydanus, in U.S. Catholic, gives a contrasting view of the film's religious inspirations, noting that the film draws from a number of Abrahamic religions for the purpose of critiquing faith itself, while also noting the "spiritualization of ecological concerns" through the Fremen.[146]

Accolades
The trailer for Dune: Part Two received nominations for Best Fantasy Adventure and the Don LaFontaine Award for Best Voice Over at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[147][148] The film was nominated for Most Anticipated Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.[149]

Future
Villeneuve has repeatedly expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah, the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended on the success of Dune: Part Two.[150][151][152] Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off series Dune: Prophecy.[153] In August 2023, Villeneuve said the third film would serve as the conclusion of a trilogy.[154] Villeneuve began developing a script for the third film in 2023.[155] In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was "almost finished" but also said he "[does not] want to rush it", citing Hollywood's tendency of focusing on release dates over a film's overall quality,[156] and adding, "I want to make sure that if we go back there a third time that it'll be worth it, and that it would make something even better than Part Two".[27] Villeneuve also considered waiting a few years for the lead actor to grow older, given that Dune Messiah is set 12 years after the events of the original book.[157]

Ahead of Dune: Part Two's release, Zimmer revealed he was already writing music for a third film after Villeneuve came in and "wordlessly" put Dune Messiah on his desk.[158]

Cillian Murphy (/ˈkɪliən/ KILL-ee-ən;[1] born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor. He made his professional debut in Enda Walsh's 1996 play Disco Pigs, a role he later reprised in the 2001 screen adaptation. His early film credits include the horror film 28 Days Later (2002), the dark comedy Intermission (2003), the thriller Red Eye (2005), the Irish war drama The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), and the science fiction thriller Sunshine (2007). He played a transgender Irish woman in the comedy-drama Breakfast on Pluto (2005), which earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination.

Murphy began his collaboration with filmmaker Christopher Nolan in 2005, playing the Scarecrow in The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012) as well as appearing in Inception (2010) and Dunkirk (2017). He gained greater prominence for his role as Tommy Shelby in the BBC period drama series Peaky Blinders (2013–2022) and for starring in the horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II (2020). Murphy portrayed J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023), for which he received the Academy Award for Best Actor, along with a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award.

In 2011, Murphy won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for the one-man play Misterman. In 2020, The Irish Times named him one of the greatest Irish film actors of all time.[2]

Early life and education

Murphy was born on 25 May 1976[3] in Douglas, Cork. His mother taught French while his father, Brendan, worked for the Department of Education.[4] His grandfather, aunts, and uncles were also teachers. He was raised in Ballintemple, Cork, alongside his younger brother Páidi and two younger sisters Sile and Orla.[5][6] He started writing and performing songs at the age of 10.[7]

Murphy was raised Catholic and attended the fee-paying Catholic secondary school Presentation Brothers College, where he did well academically but often got into trouble, sometimes being suspended; he decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle.[4] Not keen on sports, which was a major part of the school's curriculum, he found that artistic pursuits were neglected at the school.[5]

Murphy got his first taste of performing in secondary school, when he participated in a drama module presented by Corcadorca Theatre Company director Pat Kiernan. He later described the experience as a "huge high" and a "fully alive" feeling that he then set out to chase.[8] Novelist William Wall, who was his English teacher, encouraged him to pursue acting but he was set on becoming a rock star.[9] In his late teens and early 20s, he sang and played the guitar in several bands alongside his brother, Páidi, and the Beatles-obsessed duo named their most successful band The Sons of Mr. Green Genes, which they adopted from the Frank Zappa song of the same name. He later said the band "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos". They were offered a five-album deal by Acid Jazz Records, which they rejected because Páidi was still in school and the duo did not agree with the small amount of money they would get for giving the record label the rights to Murphy's compositions.[8][10] Murphy later confessed, "I'm very glad in retrospect that we didn't sign because you kind of sign away your life to a label and the whole of your music."[11]

Murphy began studying law at University College Cork (UCC) in 1996, but failed his first-year exams because he "had no ambitions to do it".[8] Not only was he busy with his band, but he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do.[7] After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of A Clockwork Orange, directed by Kiernan, he began directing his attention to acting.[8] His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, which starred Irish-American comedian Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in their production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. He later admitted that his primary motivation at the time was not to pursue an acting career, but to go to parties and meet women.[7]

Career
1996–2001: Theatre work and early roles
Murphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca Theatre Company, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs.[8] Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: "There was something about him – he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, "My God". It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time."[12] Murphy observed, "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose".[13] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork,[8] Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university[4] and his band.[9] Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.[14]

He starred in many other theatre productions, including Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing (1998), The Country Boy, and Juno and the Paycock (both 1999).[15] He began appearing in independent films such as On the Edge (2001), and in short films, including Filleann an Feall (2000) and Watchmen (2001).[16] He also reprised his role for the film adaption of Disco Pigs (2001) and appeared in the BBC television mini-series adaptation of The Way We Live Now.[14][17][18] During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to Dublin for a few years, then to London in 2001.[19]

2002–2004: 28 Days Later and breakthrough
In 2002, Murphy starred as Adam in a theatre production of Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things at the Gate Theatre in Dublin. Writing for The Irish Times, Fintan O'Toole praised Murphy's performance, "Murphy measures out his metamorphosis with an impressive subtlety and intelligence".[20]

Murphy was cast in the lead role in Danny Boyle's horror film 28 Days Later (2002). He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim, who is "perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world" after waking from a coma in a London hospital.[21] Casting director Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy for the role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs. Stevens stated that it was only after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of the film.[22][23] She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a "dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film". Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July, 28 Days Later had become a sleeper hit in North America, and success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time.[24][25] His performance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire Awards, and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards.[26][27] Murphy professed that he considered the film to be much deeper than a zombie or horror film, expressing surprise at the film's success, and that American audiences responded well to its content and violence.[28] Murphy said, "The film did so well. And you watch zombie stuff [now], we were the first people to make zombies run, and [that] changed everything. It has a very special place in my heart, that movie."[29]

In 2003, Murphy played the role of Konstantine in a stage production of Chekhov's The Seagull at the Edinburgh International Festival. He said that he wanted to play Konstantine because the character "goes on this amazing journey through the play [...] he comes to realise there's no point being an iconoclastic writer just for the sake of it, and that the search for new forms has to have something behind it".[30]

Murphy starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in Intermission (2003), which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until The Wind That Shakes the Barley broke the record in 2006).[31] Reflecting on his roles in 28 Days Later and the "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" in Intermission, Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune stated that Murphy brought "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, as much as his acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres."[32] He had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama Cold Mountain (2003). He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law's character, and was on location in Romania for only a week. Murphy stated that it was a "massive production", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he'd ever met.[28] Murphy also had a role as a butcher in Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003) with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.[33]

In 2004, Murphy toured Ireland with the Druid Theatre Company, in The Playboy of the Western World (playing the character of Christy Mahon) under the direction of Garry Hynes—who had previously directed Murphy back in 1999 in the theatre productions of Juno and the Paycock—and also in The Country Boy.[34][35]

2005–2006: Villainous roles and critical success

Murphy at the 2005 New York Film Festival
Murphy appeared as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005). Originally asked to audition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan.[19] Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow.[14] Nolan told Spin magazine, "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups".[36] He starred as Jackson Rippner, who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye (2005). The New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made "a picture-perfect villain" and that his "baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors".[37] The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.[38][39]

Murphy received several awards nominations for his 2005 villainous roles, among them a nomination as Best Villain at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for Batman Begins.[40] Entertainment Weekly ranked him among its 2005 "Summer MVPs", a cover story list of 10 entertainers with outstanding breakthrough performances.[41] The New Yorker's David Denby wrote: "Cillian Murphy, who has angelic looks that can turn sinister, is one of the most elegantly seductive monsters in recent movies."[42]

Murphy starred as Patrick/"Kitten" Braden, a transgender Irish woman in search of her mother, in Neil Jordan's comedy-drama Breakfast on Pluto (2005), based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe. Seen against the film's kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion, magic shows, red-light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to a blonde drag queen. He had auditioned for the role in 2001 and, though Jordan liked him for the part, the director of The Crying Game was hesitant to revisit transgender and IRA issues. The actor lobbied Jordan for several years in a bid to get the film made before Murphy became too old to play the part; in 2004, he prepared for the role by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites.[9] The role required "serious primping" with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal,[43] and Roger Ebert noted the way that Murphy played the character with a "bemused and hopeful voice".[44][45] While lukewarm reviews of Breakfast on Pluto tended to praise Murphy's performance highly,[46] a few critics dissented: The Village Voice, which panned the film, found him "unconvincing" and overly cute.[47] Murphy was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Breakfast on Pluto[48] and won the fourth Irish Film and Television Academy Best Actor Award.[49] Premiere magazine cited his performance as Kitten in their "The 24 Finest Performances of 2005" feature.[6]

In 2006, Murphy starred in The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a film about the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the most successful Irish independent film at the Irish box office.[50] Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to Cork, Ireland, where the film was shot. Murphy auditioned six times for the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was "tremendously proud" of the film, remarking that the "memories run very, very deep – the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle."[51] David Denby noted Murphy's moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character.[52] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training".[53] GQ magazine presented Murphy with its 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in The Wind That Shakes the Barley.[54]

2006–2010: Further theatre and film roles

Murphy (far left) with the cast of Inception in July 2010
Murphy returned to the stage starring opposite Neve Campbell at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London's West End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach's play Love Song. Theatre Record described his character of Beane as a "winsomely cranky" mentally unstable "sentimentalised lonely hero", noting how he magnetically, with "all blue eyes and twitching hands", moves "comically from painfully shy "wallpaper" to garrulous, amorous male.[55] Variety magazine considered his performance to be "as magnetic onstage as onscreen", remarking that his "unhurried puzzlement pulls the slight preciousness in the character's idiot-savant naivete back from the brink".[56]

He starred in the science fiction film Sunshine (2007) as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun, also directed by Danny Boyle.[57] He starred opposite Lucy Liu in Paul Soter's romantic comedy Watching the Detectives (2007); the indie film premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and was released direct-to-DVD.[58] Murphy starred as Richard Neville, editor of the psychedelic radical underground magazine Oz in the film Hippie Hippie Shake, which was filmed in 2007, but the project, much delayed, was eventually shelved in 2011.[59][60]

Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), the sequel to Batman Begins,[61] before starring in The Edge of Love—about a love quadrangle involving the poet Dylan Thomas—with Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys.[62] In July 2008, Murphy made a debut appearance in another medium—on a postage stamp; the Irish Post Office, An Post, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from The Wind That Shakes the Barley.[63] In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in The Water, directed by Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene and the prospect of making a silent movie, which he considered to be the "hardest test for any actor".[64] Murphy also starred in Perrier's Bounty, a crime dramedy from the makers of Intermission, in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from a gangster played by Brendan Gleeson.[65]

In 2010, he made a return to theatre in From Galway to Broadway and back again, which was a stage show that celebrated the Druid Theatre Company's 35th birthday.[66] The direct-to-video psychological thriller Peacock (2010), co-starring Elliot Page, Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman, starred Murphy as a man with a split personality who fools people into believing he is also his own wife. Christian Toto of The Washington Times referred to the film as "a handsomely mounted psychological drama with an arresting lead turn by Cillian Murphy", and noted that although Murphy wasn't a stranger to playing in drag, his work in the film set a "new standard for gender-bending performances".[67] Murphy next starred in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), playing entrepreneur Robert Fischer, whose mind is infiltrated by DiCaprio's character Cobb to convince him to dissolve his business.[68] That year, Murphy also made an uncredited cameo as programmer Edward Dillinger Jr., son of original Tron antagonist Ed Dillinger (David Warner) in Tron: Legacy.[69]

2011–present: Peaky Blinders and Oppenheimer
In 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama Misterman, written and directed by Enda Walsh, with whom he had previously worked on Disco Pigs. The production was initially staged in Galway and was taken to St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York. Murphy said of the role, "The live nature of it makes it so dangerous. You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's compounded by its being a one-man show."[12] His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award.[70][71] Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a "complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all – deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code", praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy's "unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show Misterman", and documented that on one evening the "theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance.[12] He played the lead in the British horror film Retreat (2011), which had a limited release. He also appeared in the science fiction film In Time (2011), starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorly reviewed.[72]

Murphy starred in Red Lights (2012) with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character who is a paranormal investigator. Murphy considered working with De Niro to have been one of the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: "My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it... when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else."[73] The film was panned by critics and under-performed at the box office.[74][75] Murphy went on to reprise his role as the Scarecrow for the third time in The Dark Knight Rises (2012),[76] and had a supporting role as Mike in the British independent film Broken (2012). His performance earned him a British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination.[77]


Murphy at the premiere of the second season of Peaky Blinders
Since 2013, Murphy has starred as Thomas Shelby in the BBC television series Peaky Blinders, a series about a criminal gang in Birmingham during the post-World War I period.[78] Jason Statham was initially picked for the role by director Steven Knight, who met both actors to talk about the role.[79] Knight later said, "Cillian, when you meet him, isn't Tommy, obviously, but I was stupid enough not to understand that".[79] He picked Murphy after receiving a text message from Murphy that read, "Remember, I'm an actor".[79] Murphy told The Independent, "[The scripts] were so compelling and confident, and the character was so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, 'I have to do this.'"[80] Peaky Blinders was praised and received high ratings. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. On 25 August 2019, the first episode of season 5 was broadcast on BBC One. In an interview with Digital Spy,[81] director Anthony Byrne said, "if we did start shooting in January (2021), we wouldn't finish until May or June and then it's another 6 months of editing". Series six premiered on 27 February 2022.[82] In 2013, Murphy made his directorial debut with a music video for the band Money's single Hold Me Forever. The video features dancers from the English National Ballet and was filmed at The Old Vic Theatre in London.[83]

In 2014, Murphy starred in the drama Aloft,[84] and Wally Pfister's Transcendence.[85] Both of these garnered mostly unfavourable critic reviews according to the aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[86][87] That same year, Murphy reunited with Enda Walsh in the play Ballyturk.[88][89] He starred in Ron Howard's 2015 film In the Heart of the Sea.[90] In 2015, he contributed spoken vocals to the tracks "8:58" and "The Clock" from Paul Hartnoll's album 8:58. The two previously met while Hartnoll was scoring the second season of Peaky Blinders.[91] In 2016, Murphy starred in Ben Wheatley's Free Fire,[92] and portrayed Czechoslovak World War II army soldier Jozef Gabčík, who was involved in Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Anthropoid.[93] Rupert Hawksley of The Telegraph believed Cillian's performance in Anthropoid, but opined that he is "not asked to do an awful lot, other than smoke and look perplexed".[94]


Murphy at a press conference for The Party at the Berlinale in 2017
In 2017, Murphy played a shell-shocked army officer who is recovered from a wrecked ship in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk, which emerged as a critical and box-office success.[95][96] He felt that his character, who is nameless and was credited simply as Shivering Soldier, was "representative of something experienced by thousands of soldiers, which is the profound emotional and psychological toll that war can have".[97] Murphy has also played a role in the feature film Anna as Miller, released in June 2019. His next release, A Quiet Place Part II (2021), stars Murphy as Emmett, a hardened survivor and old family friend of the Abbotts. Murphy's character reluctantly takes in the Abbotts following the events of the first film.[98] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised his performance.[99]

Murphy portrayed J. Robert Oppenheimer in the biographical thriller Oppenheimer.[100][101] The film marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy lost a significant amount of weight to match Oppenheimer's near-emaciated appearance, extensively researched Oppenheimer's life and took inspiration from David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[102] Released in 2023, the film grossed over $964 million worldwide and garnered positive reviews from critics.[103][104] Murphy's performance was lauded, with Empire's Dan Jolin writing: "At the film's pulsing nucleus is Murphy as Oppenheimer, and he is compelling throughout."[105] For his performance, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and Academy Award for Best Actor.[106]

Murphy launched the independent production company Big Things Films with Alan Moloney in February 2024.[107] He is set to produce and star in two film adaptations: the historical drama Small Things like These, which opened the 74th Berlin International Film Festival,[108] and Steve, through a collaboration with Netflix.[107] Murphy will also executive produce the sequel to 28 Days Later, titled 28 Years Later, and is in talks to reprise his role.[109]

Public image
Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience "a challenge" that he does not "want to overcome".[110] He intentionally practises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids, stating, "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk".[5] He prefers not to speak about his life outside of acting and did not appear on any television talk shows until 2010, when he was a guest on Ireland's Late Late Show to promote Perrier's Bounty, though he still remained reserved.[111][112]

In 2015, Murphy was named one of GQ's 50 best-dressed men,[113] and in 2024, he was announced as the new face of Italian luxury fashion company Versace.[114]

Activism
Murphy participated in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election,[115] and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organisation Focus Ireland.[116] In 2011, he became a patron of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of Ireland Galway. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for "highlighting [what] is hugely important to us all as a nation".[117][118] Murphy was a supporter of the 2018 Irish referendum to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution that restricted access to abortions, appearing on the Blindboy Podcast to urge men to support women and vote in favour of the referendum.[119][120][121][122]

Personal life
In 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend Yvonne McGuinness, whom he met at one of his rock band's shows in 1996.[123] They lived in Dublin until 2001, when they moved to London so his wife could attend the Royal College of Art. After 14 years, they moved back to Dublin in 2015. They have two sons, born in 2005 and 2007.[124][125]

Murphy was raised Catholic and had been verging on agnosticism until researching his role as a physicist and astronaut in the 2007 film Sunshine, which confirmed his atheism.[126][127] In 2019, he said the Catholic faith still shaped his morality.[128][129]

He was a vegetarian for around 15 years, which he said happened because he was "worried about getting mad cow disease" rather than a moral decision.[130] He also had qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices.[131] He began eating meat again to bulk up for his role in Peaky Blinders.[130] In a 2022 interview, he said he had returned to vegetarianism.[132]

Acting credits and awards

Murphy's most commercially successful films have been his many collaborations with Nolan, including Oppenheimer, Inception, Batman Begins, and Dunkirk.[133] Following the success of Oppenheimer and the Barbenheimer phenomenon, Murphy was named in Variety's list of the most influential figures of 2023 in the entertainment and media industry.[134] Murphy's works also include other critically acclaimed films, such as A Quiet Place II and The Wind that Shakes the Barley.[133] He has received several accolades over the course of his career, including three Irish Film & Television Awards,[49][135][136] a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award.[106]
Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor. His films as a leading actor have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Downey's career has been characterized by some early success, a period of drug-related problems and run-ins with the law, and a surge in popular and commercial success in the 2000s.[2] In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. From 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.

At the age of five, Downey made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). Downey's portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic Chaplin received a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal in 2000, and won a Golden Globe Award for the role. Downey was fired from the show in 2001 in the wake of additional drug charges. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.

Downey made his acting comeback in the 2003 film The Singing Detective, after Mel Gibson paid his insurance bond because completion bond companies would not insure him.[3] He went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008). Downey gained global recognition for starring as Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008), and leading up to Avengers: Endgame (2019). He has also played Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Downey has also taken on dramatic parts in The Judge (2014) and Oppenheimer (2023), winning an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the latter.

Early life
Robert John Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of two children.[4] His father, Robert Downey Sr., was a filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (née Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films.[5] Downey's father was of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one-quarter Irish descent, while Downey's mother had Scottish, German, and Swiss ancestry.[6][7][8] Downey moved often, mainly due to his father's film projects, living in places such as Woodstock, New York, London, New Mexico, California, Connecticut and Greenwich Village.[9] The family experienced both periods of near-poverty and wealth, depending on the success of the films.[10]

As a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs".[11] His father was a drug addict and his mother was an alcoholic.[12] His father allowed him to use drugs at a young age; he said that he gave Downey marijuana for the first time at age six, and that Downey also "might have had a little coke" as a child.[13] His father later said that he regretted it.[4] Downey stated that he and his father did drugs together for the first time when he was eight, and that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: "When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how".[14][15][16]

During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy film Pound (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Western film Greaser's Palace (1972).[7] He went to Stagedoor Manor, a summer acting camp in upstate New York, when he was eleven and twelve.[10] Downey's parents divorced in 1977, when he was twelve. He went and lived with his mother, in a fifth-floor walk up in New York, as she "needed" him after the divorce, while his sister went to live with their father in California.[14] After a few years Downey went to live with his father and began attending Santa Monica High School, but dropped out in 1982.[17] At the age of 17 he moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.[18]

Downey worked a number of different jobs to support himself while going to auditions, including clearing tables at Central Falls restaurant, working in a shoe store, and performing as "living art" at the nightclub Area.[19][20][21] Meanwhile, Downey got a few parts in local theatre and off-Broadway productions. He got his first film role in the 1983 film Baby It’s You, however his scenes ended up being cut.[22][23]

Career
1983–1995: Early work and critical acclaim

Downey began building upon theater roles, making his debut on stage in 1983 at the Geva Theatre Center in Alms for the Middle Class, for a three-week run.[24] He also performed in the short-lived off-Broadway musical American Passion at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear.[25] In 1984, Downey got a part in the film Firstborn, where he met Sarah Jessica Parker, and the pair started dating.[26] In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for Saturday Night Live. Downey has said that Anthony Michael Hall, who he had met and become friends with on the set of his Weird Science, had helped him get the audition.[27] However, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's comedic talents.[18] Rolling Stone magazine named Downey the worst SNL cast member in its entire run, stating that the "Downey Fail sums up everything that makes SNL great".[28]

That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's sidekick in Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes's Weird Science. Molly Ringwald wanted him for the role of Duckie in John Hughes's film Pretty in Pink (1986), but the part went to Jon Cryer.[29][30] He went on to star with Ringwald in his first lead role in The Pick-up Artist (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack.[18][31] Downey moved to Hollywood and lived with fellow actors Billy Zane, who later appeared with Downey in Only You (1994), Sarah Jessica Parker and Kiefer Sutherland, who starred with Downey in 1969 (1988).[32][33]

In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less than Zero. His performance, described by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as "desperately moving",[34] was widely praised, though Downey has said that for him "the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future" since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an "exaggeration of the character" in real life.[35] Soon after completing the film, Downey went into rehab for the first time; the episode would be followed by a number of interventions and stints in rehab over the next decade prior to his 1996 arrest.[36][37] Zero drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as Chances Are (1989) with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, Air America (1990) with Mel Gibson, and Soapdish (1991) with Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Cathy Moriarty, and Whoopi Goldberg.[38][39][40]

In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, a role for which he prepared extensively, learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in order to help him imitate Chaplin's posture and way of carrying himself.[41] The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman.[42] In 1993, he appeared in the films Heart and Souls with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and Short Cuts with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary that he wrote about the 1992 presidential campaigns titled The Last Party (1993).[43][44][45] He starred in the 1994 films, Only You with Marisa Tomei, and Natural Born Killers with Woody Harrelson.[46][47] He then subsequently appeared in Restoration (1995), Richard III (1995), Home for the Holidays (1995), Two Girls and a Guy (1997),[48] as Special Agent John Royce in U.S. Marshals (1998), and in Black and White (1999).[49][50][51][52]

1996–2001: Addiction-related setbacks and Ally McBeal
From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested several times on charges related to drugs including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.[53] He went through drug treatment programs and time in county jail and prison. He explained in 1999 to a judge: "It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal." He said he had been addicted to drugs since the age of eight due to the fact that his father had been giving them to him.[54]

In early 1996, after becoming increasingly concerned for Downey, Sean Penn and Dennis Quaid knocked his door down, took his keys and took him to a rehab centre in Tucson, however Downey escaped and checked himself out a few days later.[36] In June 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, crack and an unloaded .357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard. A month later, while on parole, he wandered into a neighbor's home through the unlocked front door while under the influence of a controlled substance and fell asleep in one of the beds.[55][56] The family refused to press trespassing charges.[37] The tape of the neighbor's 911 call was made available online, and it became known as the "goldilocks incident".[57] In November 1996, after spending time in court ordered rehab, he received a further six-months of live-in rehab, three years' probation and was ordered to undergo compulsory drug testing.[37] In 1997, he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend six months in the Los Angeles County jail.[58] After being released, he went into a court-ordered 120-day rehab program.[37]

In 1999, after being clean during the shooting of Wonder Boys, Downey relapsed. During this time he was struggling with legal bills and had lost his house in Malibu.[36] After Downey missed another required drug test in 1999, he was arrested again. Despite Downey's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, assembling the same team of lawyers that had successfully defended O. J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder,[54] Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California.[59] At the time of the arrest, all of Downey's film projects had wrapped and were close to release. He had been hired to provide the voice of the devil on the NBC animated television series God, the Devil and Bob, but was fired when he failed to attend rehearsals.[59][60]

After spending nearly a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Downey, on condition of posting a $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release.[4] A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal, playing a new love interest.[61] He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.[62][63] He also appeared as a writer and singer on Vonda Shepard's Ally McBeal: For Once in My Life album, and sang with Sting a duet of "Every Breath You Take" in an episode of the series. Despite the apparent success, Downey claimed that his performance on the series was overrated and said, "It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give a fuck whether I ever acted again."[35] In January 2001, Downey was scheduled to play the role of Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson.[64]

Before the end of his first season on Ally McBeal, Downey was arrested on Thanksgiving in 2000, when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California, was searched by the police, who were responding to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium.[65][66] Rolling Stone later ran a six-page investigation into the weekend's events.[36] Despite the fact that, if convicted, he would have faced a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes.[67]

In April 2001, while Downey was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefoot in Culver City. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later,[68] even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system.[69] After this last arrest, Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and fired Downey, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeal's ratings.[70] The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts,[69] and the subsequent incarceration prompted Gibson to cancel his Hamlet production. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and received three years of probation, benefiting from California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.[4][71] Downey spent a year at the court-ordered drug-treatment facility. By this time Downey was homeless, too much of an insurance liability to be employable and on the verge of bankruptcy.[36]

The book Conversations with Woody Allen reports that director Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2003 but was unable to do so because he could not get insurance on them. Allen stated, "We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on Celebrity] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent."[72]

In a December 18, 2000, article for People magazine titled "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder "a few years ago" and added that this was "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy".[73] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth, claimed she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that "no one had done a complete [psychiatric] evaluation [on him] ... I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I spend a lot of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'"[73]

In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey stated that he wanted to address "this whole thing about the bipolar" after receiving a phone call from "the Bipolar Association" asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, "'No! Dr. Malibusian said [I said I was bipolar] ... ', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'"[74] Downey flatly denied being "depressed or manic" and said that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because "the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober."[74]

2001–2007: Resurgence
After five years of substance abuse, arrests, rehabilitation, and relapse, Downey was ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot."[75] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems ... what's hard is to decide to do it."[75]

Downey got his first post-rehabilitation acting job in August 2001, lip-syncing in the video for Elton John's single "I Want Love".[76] Video director Sam Taylor-Wood shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because, according to John, Downey looked completely relaxed and "the way he underplays it is fantastic".[77] Downey was able to return to the big screen after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective (directed by his Back to School co-star Keith Gordon).[3] Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40% of Downey's salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses became standard in his contracts throughout the 2000s.[78] Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin (later Susan Downey), also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.[79]

After Gothika, Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, Good Night, and Good Luck, Richard Linklater's dystopian, rotoscoped A Scanner Darkly (in which Downey plays the role of a drug addict), and Steven Shainberg's fictional biographical film of Diane Arbus, Fur, in which Downey's character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus's professional life, Lisette Model and Marvin Israel.[80] Downey also received great notice for his roles in more mainstream fare such as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Disney's poorly received The Shaggy Dog.[81]

On November 23, 2004, Downey released his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, for which he designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio.[82] The album received mixed reviews,[83][84] but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.[85] In 2006, Downey returned to television when he did voice acting on Family Guy in the episode "The Fat Guy Strangler". Downey had previously telephoned the show's production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son Indio is a fan of the show. The producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt, Lois Griffin's long lost, mentally disturbed brother, for Downey.[86]

Downey signed on with publishers HarperCollins to write a memoir, which in 2006, was already being billed as a "candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career". In 2008, however, Downey returned his advance to the publishers, and canceled the book without further comment.[87] In 2007, Downey appeared in David Fincher's mystery thriller Zodiac, which was based on a true story. He played the role of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Paul Avery, who was reporting the Zodiac Killer case.[88]

2008–2019: Iron Man and further success

Despite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a "blockbuster" film. That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. In the article Ben Stiller wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of The Time 100, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office:

Yes, Downey is Iron Man, but he really is Actor Man ... In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king, the realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect.

— Ben Stiller, The 2008 Time 100, entry No. 60, "Robert Downey Jr."[89]
In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film Iron Man,[90] with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating: "Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'."[91] Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the Pirates of the Caribbean series: a lead actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it.[55][92][93][94] For the role, Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he "had the power to forge iron".[95]

Iron Man was released worldwide between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million worldwide[96] and receiving rave reviews which cited Downey's performance as a highlight of the film.[97][98][99] By October 2008, Downey had agreed to star in two Iron Man sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as The Avengers, featuring the superhero team that Stark joins, based on Marvel's comic book series The Avengers.[100] He first reprised the role in a small appearance as Iron Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, as a part of Marvel Studios' depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the movies.[101]

After Iron Man, Downey appeared alongside Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the Stiller-directed Tropic Thunder. The three actors play a Hollywood archetype – with Downey playing self-absorbed multi-Oscar-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus – as they star in an extremely expensive Vietnam-era film called Tropic Thunder. Lazarus undergoes a "controversial skin pigmentation procedure" in order to take on the role of African-American platoon sergeant Lincoln Osiris, which required Downey to wear dark makeup and a wig. Both Stiller and Downey feared Downey's portrayal of the character could become controversial:

Stiller says that he and Downey always stayed focused on the fact that they were skewering insufferable actors, not African Americans. "I was trying to push it as far as you can within reality", Stiller explains. "I had no idea how people would respond to it". Stiller screened a rough cut of the film [in March 2008] and it scored high with African Americans. He was relieved at the reaction. "It seems people really embrace it", he said.[102]

When asked by Harry Smith on CBS's The Early Show who his model was for Lazarus, Downey laughed before responding, "Sadly, my sorry-ass self."[103]

Released in the United States on August 13, 2008, Tropic Thunder received good reviews with 83% of reviews positive and an average normalized score of 71, according to the review aggregator websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively.[104][105] It earned US$26 million in its North American opening weekend and retained the number one position for its first three weekends of release. The film grossed $180 million in theaters before its release on home video on November 18, 2008. Downey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lazarus.[106]

Opening in late April 2009 was a film Downey finished in mid-2008, The Soloist. The film was delayed from a November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures due to the studio's tight end-of-year release schedule.[107] Critics who had seen the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate.[108] Downey picked up an Academy Award nomination for the 2008 release year for his role in Tropic Thunder.[109]

The first role Downey accepted after Iron Man was Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's adaptation Sherlock Holmes. Warner Bros. released it on December 25, 2009.[110] The film set several box office records in the United States for a Christmas Day release, beating the previous record-holder, 2008's Marley & Me, by nearly $10 million, and finished second to Avatar in a record-setting Christmas weekend box office. Sherlock Holmes ended up being the 8th highest-grossing film of 2009.[111][112] When Downey won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for his role as Sherlock Holmes, he noted in his acceptance speech that he had prepared no remarks because "Susan Downey told me that Matt Damon was going to win so don't bother preparing a speech".[113]

Downey returned as Tony Stark in the first of two planned sequels to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, which released in May 2010. Iron Man 2 grossed over $623 million worldwide, becoming the 7th highest-grossing film of 2010.[114] Downey's other commercial film release of 2010 was the comedy road film, Due Date. The movie, co-starring Zach Galifianakis, was released in November 2010[115] and grossed over $211M worldwide, making it the 36th highest-grossing movie of 2010.[116] Downey's sole 2011 film credit was Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which opened worldwide on December 16, 2011.[117]


Downey speaking at the 2019 Disney Legends Awards
In 2012, Downey reprised the role of Tony Stark in The Avengers. The film received positive reviews[118] and was highly successful at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time both in the United States and worldwide.[119] His film, the David Dobkin-directed dramedy The Judge,[120] a project co-produced by his production company Team Downey, was the opening film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014.[121] Downey played Tony Stark again in Iron Man 3 (2013),[122] Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017),[123] Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[123] Three of his scenes from The Avengers and Avengers: Endgame were used as archive footage in the first episode of the Disney+ series Loki.[124]

Downey hosted The Age of A.I., a YouTube documentary series released in 2019.[125]

2020–present: Post-Marvel
In 2020, Downey starred in Dolittle, playing the titular character, depicted in the film as a 19th-century Welsh veterinarian who can communicate with animals. This was the second film from Team Downey. It was a box office disappointment and received negative reviews from critics, who called it "too long [and] lifeless".[126]

In 2023, Downey portrayed antagonistic bureaucrat Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. He took a pay cut to work on the film, earning $4 million in lieu of his usual $10–20 million upfront salary.[127] Downey would later describe Oppenheimer as "the best film" in which he has appeared to date.[128] The biopic and Downey's performance received critical acclaim.[129][130][131] For the role, he won a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[132]

Downey will next co-star in the television adaptation of novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen's novel, The Sympathizer.[133] It was also announced he would star in the film Play Dirty, reuniting with Shane Black, the director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3.[134]

Other ventures
Music
Downey has sung on several soundtracks for his films, including for Chaplin, Too Much Sun, Two Girls and a Guy, Friends and Lovers, The Singing Detective, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. In 2001, he appeared in the music video for Elton John's song, "I Want Love". He released a CD in 2004 called The Futurist, and while promoting his film Tropic Thunder, he and his co-stars Ben Stiller and Jack Black were back-up singers "The Pips" to Gladys Knight singing "Midnight Train to Georgia".[135]

Downey's most commercially successful recording venture to date (combining sales and radio airplay) has been his remake of the 1973 Joni Mitchell Christmas song "River", which was included on the Ally McBeal tie-in album Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas, released in 2000; Downey's character Larry Paul performs the song in the Ally McBeal episode "Tis the Season".[136]

Business
On June 14, 2010, Downey and his wife Susan opened their own production company called Team Downey. Their first project was The Judge.[137] In 2024, Downey launched a coffee company named Happy with Craig Dubitsky.[138]

Personal life
Relationships and family
Downey started dating actress Sarah Jessica Parker in 1984 after meeting her on the set of Firstborn. They were both 18 and moved in together after eight weeks of dating.[26] The couple separated eight years later in 1991 due to his drug addiction.[139]

Downey married actress and singer Deborah Falconer on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship.[140] Their son was born in September 1993.[141] The strain on their marriage from Downey's repeated trips to rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in 2001, in the midst of Downey's last arrest and sentencing to an extended stay in rehab, Falconer left Downey and took their son with her.[140] Downey and Falconer finalized their divorce on April 26, 2004.


Downey with wife Susan Downey at the 2010 Academy Awards
In 2003, Downey met producer Susan Downey (née Levin), an executive vice-president of production at Joel Silver's film company, Silver Pictures, on the set of Gothika.[3] Though Susan twice turned down his romantic advances, she and Downey did quietly strike up a romance during production.[142] Despite Susan's worries that the romance would not last after the completion of shooting given that "he's an actor; I have a real job",[142] the couple's relationship continued after production wrapped on Gothika, and Downey proposed to Susan on the night before her thirtieth birthday.[142] In August 2005, the couple were married, in a Jewish ceremony, at Amagansett, New York.[143][144] A tattoo on one of his biceps reads "Suzie Q" in tribute to her.[145] The Downeys' first child, a son, was born in February 2012,[146] and their second, a daughter, was born in November 2014.[147][148][149]

Downey has been a close friend of Mel Gibson since they starred in Air America. Downey defended Gibson during the controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said "nobody's perfect" in reference to Gibson's 2006 DUI.[150] Gibson said of Downey: "He was one of the first people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go see what we can do to work on ourselves.'"[151] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.[152]

Sobriety
Downey says he has been drug-free since July 2003[153] and credited his wife with helping him overcome his drug and alcohol habits, along with his family, therapy, meditation, twelve-step recovery programs, yoga, and the practice of Wing Chun kung fu,[35] the martial art he learned from Eric Oram, who is also a fight consultant in several of Downey's movies.[154][155] Oram was Downey's personal fight coordinator in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War.[156] In December 2015, Downey was chosen as one of 91 people to be pardoned by the Governor of California Jerry Brown, for his prior drug offences. The pardon does not erase Downey's criminal record, but it does allow him to serve on a jury.[157][158] Oram wrote a letter in support of Downey's pardon to Governor Brown.[159] When asked on The Oprah Winfrey Show how he was able to make his sobriety stick this time, Downey said: "It's really not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems. What's hard is to decide to do it."[160]

Religious beliefs
Downey has described his religious beliefs as "Jewish Buddhist",[161] and he is reported to have consulted astrologers.[162] In the past, Downey has been interested in Christianity and the Hare Krishna movement.[161]

Political views
In a 2008 interview, Downey stated that his time in prison changed his political point of view somewhat, saying: "I have a really interesting political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since."[163]

However, when asked about the quote in a 2015 interview to promote Avengers: Age of Ultron, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated: "I wouldn't say that I'm a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat."[164]

Downey has shown support for the Democratic Party. He donated to Barack Obama's Presidential Campaign in 2012.[165] In 2014, Downey attended a fundraiser for the Democratic Party and donated to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.[166] In 2016, Downey appeared in an Internet video urging the American public to vote against Donald Trump in the then-upcoming presidential election.[167] In 2020, Downey took part in a virtual fundraiser for Joe Biden's Presidential Campaign, with fellow Avengers actors, and the vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris.[168][169]

Downey serves on the board of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, a nonprofit organisation which advocates for criminal justice reform, to reduce incarceration, improve the outcomes of formerly incarcerated individuals, and build healthier communities.[170]

Environmentalism
In January 2020, during the promotions of his film Dolittle, Downey announced that he had made the decision to adopt a vegan diet, in response to the debate about the climate crisis, stating that "I'm a one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus"[171] and believes he can do his part to contribute. Downey previously announced his opening of Footprint Coalition, an organization he launched to reduce carbon footprints around the world using advanced technology.[172] The Footprint Coalition promotes technologies that protect the environment such as French insect-farming startup Ynsect,[173] the bio-based alternative to plastic manufacturer RWDC,[174] and bamboo toilet paper manufacturer Cloud Paper.[175][176]

In January 2024, Downey stated that he was a pescetarian and had to give up his vegan diet due to low levels of vitamin B12, calcium and iron.[177] He co-authored Cool Food: Erasing Your Carbon Footprint One Bite at a Time which advocates a low-carbon plant-based diet to reduce carbon footprint.[177][178]

A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso and steamed milk. It generally has a higher proportion of espresso to milk than a caffè latte, and lacks the thick layer of foam in a cappuccino. While the origin of the flat white is unclear, various café owners in Australia and New Zealand claim its invention.

Description
Anette Moldvaer states that a flat white consists of a double espresso (50 ml/1.5 fl oz) and about 130 ml (4 fl oz) of steamed milk with a 5 mm (0.25 inch) layer of microfoam.[1] According to a survey of industry commentators, a flat white is a shorter drink with a thin layer of microfoam (hence the 'flat' in flat white), as opposed to the thick layer of foam on the top of a cappuccino.[2] The beverage usually features a pattern (latte art) on the surface.[1]

The way a flat white is made, however, varies between regions and cafés. In Australia a flat white is usually served in a ceramic cup with a handle, often of a similar volume (200 ml, 7.0 imp fl oz) to the glass in which a latte is served, but the flat white usually has less milk and microfoam.[3] According to New Zealand tourism, flat whites are more commonly served in a smaller cup (175 ml, 6.2 imp fl oz). In both Australia and New Zealand, there is a generally accepted difference between lattes and flat whites in the ratio of milk to coffee and the consistency of the milk due to the amount of microfoam produced when the milk is heated.[4]

A true flat white ought to have the same quantity of extracted coffee as any other beverage on the coffee menu (generally 30 ml, 1.1 imp fl oz) but because it is served in a smaller vessel (175 ml, 6.2 imp fl oz) it has stronger flavour than say a latte which is normally served in a 225 ml (7.9 imp fl oz) vessel and is subsequently milkier. The consistency of the milk is another point of difference between a flat white and a latte – a latte has a creamy, velvety layer of milk on the surface which can vary in depth depending on where you buy your coffee. A flat white has a thinner layer of the textured milk, ideally with a shinier surface.

Origins and history
Coffee historian Ian Bersten states that while the origin of the flat white is unclear, the drink probably originated in England in the 1950s.[6]

There are references to the beverage in Australia in the 1980s. A review of the Sydney café Miller's Treat in May 1983 refers to their "flat white coffee".[7] Another Sydney newspaper article in April 1984 satirised a vogue for caffè latte, stating that: "cafe latte translates as flat white."[8]

At Moors Espresso Bar in Sydney, Alan Preston added the beverage to his permanent menu in 1985.[6][9] Preston claimed he had imported the idea to Sydney from his native Queensland, where cafés in the 1960s and 1970s had frequently offered "White Coffee – flat".[10] Other documented references include the Parliament House cafeteria in Canberra putting up a sign in January 1985 saying "flat white only" during a seasonal problem with milk cows that prevented the milk froth from forming.[11][12]


Bar Bodega in Wellington, which also claims to have originated the drink
However, the origins of the flat white are contentious, with New Zealand also claiming its invention.[13][6] One New Zealand claim originates in Auckland, by Derek Townsend and Darrell Ahlers of Cafe DKD, as an alternative to the Italian latte,[14][15] and a second New Zealand claim originates from Wellington as a result of a "failed cappuccino" at Bar Bodega on Willis St in 1989.[13] Craig Miller, author of Coffee Houses of Wellington 1939 to 1979, claims to have prepared a flat white in Auckland in the mid-1980s.[13]

Similar beverages
The flat white is similar to a cappuccino, which is a single espresso with heated milk and a layer of thick foam served in a 150–160 ml (5.3–5.6 imp fl oz) cup.[16] The flat white, however, does not have the thick layer of foam, but rather made with only steamed milk containing microfoam.[1]

The flat white is similar to a caffè latte, which is espresso with steamed milk added, served in a glass. A flat white has less milk and less microfoam than a latte.[3]
Damsel is a 2024 American dark fantasy film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and written by Dan Mazeau. Millie Bobby Brown stars as Elodie, who accepts a marriage proposal only to realize that she is being used to repay a royal family's ancient debts, and must now escape while surviving attacks from the dragon lurking in the chasm. The rest of the principal cast consists of Ray Winstone, Nick Robinson, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Angela Bassett, and Robin Wright.

Damsel began streaming on Netflix to mixed reviews on March 8, 2024.

Plot
The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the dragon's mercy.

Centuries later, Elodie, the adolescent daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage to help their impoverished people. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry initially both seem uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, fails to befriend Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement.

After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters for peace. Following a ceremony where their hands are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the dragon's lair, then throws her down the chasm.

Recovering from the fall, Elodie realizes that she is the actual sacrifice. She escapes the dragon after it burns her leg and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing slugs, which she collects as a light source. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note "Safe Here She Cannot Reach," the names of past victims and a map carved into the wall. In Elodie's sleep, the slugs heal the burn on her leg.

Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, providing the reason for the royal sacrifices. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. The dragon kills them, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit.

The conflagration alerts Isabelle that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, forcing her to kidnap Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. After Lady Bayford rides out and informs her, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, who is left alive as bait.

Elodie creates a diversion for the dragon to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the dragon think of the princesses as Aurean royalty. The dragon refuses to believe Elodie, stating that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her, but Elodie tricks her into burning herself. With the dragon at her mercy, she heals both of them with the glowing slugs.

Elodie then interrupts another wedding at the palace, exposing the Aureans' treachery. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the dragon.

Production
Damsel was directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo from a script by Dan Mazeau, and produced by Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum through their production company for Netflix.[2] Emily Ballou and Mark Bomback were credited for "additional literary material" off-screen.[3]

In November 2020, Millie Bobby Brown was cast as Princess Elodie; she was also named as the film's executive producer.[2] In April 2022, it was reported that Angela Bassett, Nick Robinson, Robin Wright, Ray Winstone, Brooke Carter, and Shohreh Aghdashloo were part of the cast.[4][5]

Principal photography took place in early 2022.[6] Cave scenes were shot at Troubadour Meridian Water Studios in London. Filming also took place in Portugal at Tomar, Sortelha, Serra da Estrela, and at the Batalha Monastery.[7] The dragon was designed by Patrick Tatopoulos.[8]

The film's score was composed by David Fleming and produced by Hans Zimmer.[9] The soundtrack includes a cover of the Johnny Cash song "Ring of Fire", performed by Lykke Li. Netflix Music released the soundtrack album digitally on March 5, 2024.[10]

Release
Damsel was scheduled to stream on Netflix on October 13, 2023.[11] However, due to the impact of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike on the film's promotion, the original release date was postponed and the film began streaming on March 8, 2024.[12][13]

Novel
Author Evelyn Skye released a novelization of the film in advance. She stated: "The easiest way to think about it is this: Dan Mazeau wrote the original screenplay. I was able to read an early draft and was given free rein to write my own version of the story, which ultimately became the novel. Both the novel and the movie may stem from the same origin, but they are also each their own unique works of art".[14]

The novel was published by Penguin Random House on April 18, 2023.[15]

Reception
Audience viewership
According to Netflix, in the first three days the film recorded 35.3 million views and placed number one in 79 countries.[16][17] It also had 64.8 hours viewed within the same time period.[17]

Critical response
The film received mixed reviews.[18][19] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 118 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website's consensus reads: "Damsel has an appealing action hero in Millie Bobby Brown, whose gutsy performance is often enough to balance the scales against the film's underpowered story and occasionally unconvincing effects."[20] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[21]

Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle criticized Brown's character, but praised her commitment to the role, writing "The movie could have used a little less of Brown cowering behind boulders as the flames get closer and a little more of her getting even with the people who put her in this predicament".[22] Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, "Deliciously improper at times, Damsel adheres to codes that can feel a bit calculated, less organic than crafted in response to a newly progressive corporate agenda (the signs are there at all levels, from inclusive casting to occasionally self-righteous dialogue)".[9] Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave it a grade of "C+".[13] Tim Robey of The Telegraph awarded it one star out of five, writing "If a straight-to-landfill quality is synonymous with the worst of Netflix, Damsel sums this up by having the tackiness of a plastic wedding cake."[23]
Ryan Thomas Gosling (/ˈɡɒslɪŋ/ GOSS-ling;[1] born November 12, 1980) is a Canadian actor who has appeared in numerous independent films and major studio features. His films have grossed of over $1.9 billion worldwide, and he has received various accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, and has been nominated for three Academy Awards and two BAFTAs.

Gosling rose to prominence at age 13 on Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club (1993–1995), and went on to appear in other family entertainment programs, including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995) and Goosebumps (1996). His breakthrough film role was that of a Jewish neo-Nazi in The Believer (2001), and he gained stardom in the 2004 romantic drama The Notebook.

Gosling starred in the critically acclaimed independent dramas Half Nelson (2006), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor; Lars and the Real Girl (2007), and Blue Valentine (2010). He starred in three mainstream successes in 2011: the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love, the political drama The Ides of March, and the action thriller Drive. After making his directorial debut with Lost River (2014), he starred in the financial satire The Big Short (2015), the action comedy The Nice Guys (2016), and the romantic musical La La Land (2016), the latter of which won him a Golden Globe and a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Further acclaim followed with the science fiction film Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and the biopic First Man (2018). In 2023, he played Ken in the fantasy comedy Barbie, which emerged as his highest-grossing release and earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Gosling's band, Dead Man's Bones, released their self-titled debut album and toured North America in 2009. He is a co-owner of Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.

He has been involved in peace promotion efforts in Africa for over a decade. He is in a relationship with actress Eva Mendes, with whom he has two daughters.

Early life and education
Ryan Thomas Gosling was born on November 12, 1980, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,[2] the son of Thomas Ray Gosling, a traveling salesman for a paper mill,[3] and Donna, a secretary.[4][5] Both of his parents are of part French Canadian descent, along with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish.[6][7] He and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[8] and Gosling has said that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives.[9] Because of his father's work, they "moved around a lot"[3] and Gosling lived in both Cornwall, Ontario[10] and Burlington, Ontario.[11] His parents divorced when he was 13,[12] and he and his older sister Mandi lived with their mother,[4] an experience Gosling has credited with programming him "to think like a girl".[13]

Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School,[14] Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School.[15] As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor.[16] He "hated" being a child,[9][17] was bullied in elementary school,[18] and had no friends until he was "14 or 15".[19][20] In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a suspension.[17] He was unable to read,[21] and was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but was not diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, never took medication.[22] His mother left her job and home-schooled him for a year.[23] He has said homeschooling gave him "a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost".[9] Gosling performed in front of audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer.[24] He and his sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act,[25] and was involved with a local ballet company.[26] Performing boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing for which he received praise.[20] He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did not sound "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando.[27] Gosling dropped out of high school at age 17 to focus on his acting career.[28]

Acting career
1993–1999: Child actor
In 1993, 12-year-old Gosling attended an open audition in Montreal for a revival of the Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club.[24] He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida.[28] He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented.[29] Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life.[28] Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake. Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in him "this great sense of focus."[30] He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons.[31] Gosling has said that even though he and Timberlake talk infrequently, they are still supportive of each other.[30]

Following the show's cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada, where he continued to appear in family entertainment television series, including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995)[32] and Goosebumps (1996),[32] and starred in Breaker High (1997–98) as Sean Hanlon.[32] At age eighteen, he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series Young Hercules (1998–1999) as the title character.[32] He later said that he initially enjoyed working on the series, but began to care too much about the show, so it was no longer fun for him. He wanted to spend more time sitting with and devising a character as well as play a variety of roles, so he chose to transition into film and not accept any more television work.[28]

2000–2003: Independent films
Aged 19, Gosling decided to move into "serious acting". He was dropped by his agent and initially found it difficult to secure work because of the "stigma" attached to children's television.[33] After a supporting role in the football drama Remember the Titans, he secured a lead role as a young Jewish neo-Nazi in 2001's The Believer. Director Henry Bean said he cast Gosling because his Mormon upbringing helped him understand the isolation of Judaism.[34] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised an "electrifying and terrifyingly convincing" performance[35] while Todd McCarthy of Variety felt his "dynamite performance" could "scarcely have been better".[36] The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival[37] and Gosling has described it as "the film that kind of gift-wrapped for me the career that I have now."[25] Because of the controversial nature of the film, it was difficult to secure financial backing for a full theatrical release,[38] and the film was instead broadcast on Showtime.[38] The film was a commercial failure, grossing $416,925 worldwide from a production budget of $1.5 million.[39]

In 2002, Gosling co-starred in the psychological thriller Murder by Numbers with Sandra Bullock and Michael Pitt,[40] where Gosling and Pitt portrayed a pair of high school seniors who believe they can commit the perfect murder. Bullock played the detective tasked with investigating the crime. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described him as "a phenomenal talent even in junk like this"[41] while Todd McCarthy felt that the "strong and "charismatic" young actors were "let down by the screenplay".[42] The film was a minor commercial success, grossing $56 million worldwide from a production budget of $50 million.[43] His second screen appearance of 2002 was in The Slaughter Rule with David Morse which explores the relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach in rural Montana. Gosling has said that the opportunity to work with Morse made him "a better actor".[44] Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Gosling as "major star material" with a "rawness and an intensity that recall the young Matt Dillon"[45] while Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was won over by his "raw talent".[46] The film was released in just three US theatres and grossed $13,411.[47]

In 2003, Gosling starred in The United States of Leland as a teenager imprisoned for the murder of a disabled boy. He was drawn to the role because it was unusual to find a character that was "emotionally disconnected for the whole film."[48] Critic Roger Ebert felt that the "gifted actor does everything that can be done with Leland, but the character comes from a writer's conceits, not from life."[49] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that he "struggles to rescue Leland from the clutches of cliché"[50] while David Rooney of Variety felt that his "one-note, blankly disturbed act has none of the magnetic edge of his breakthrough work in The Believer".[51] The film grossed $343,847 in the United States and was not released overseas.[52]

2004–2009: The Notebook and Half Nelson
Gosling gained mainstream attention in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes.[53] Gosling played Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: "It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative."[54] He sought to imbue his character with "quiet strength" and was inspired by Sam Shepard's performance in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook.[55] Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003.[56] Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set.[57][58] "We inspired the worst in each other," Gosling has said. "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way."[9]

At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" because he felt McAdams was uncooperative.[58] The New York Times praised the "spontaneous and combustible" performances of the two leads and noted that, "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds against them."[59] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's "beguiling unaffectedness" and noted that "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together".[60] The film grossed over $115 million worldwide.[61] Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards[62] and an MTV Movie Award.[63] Entertainment Weekly has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss[64] while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses.[65] The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists.[66][67][68][69]


Gosling at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival
In 2005, Gosling appeared as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated that Gosling "like his fans, deserves better."[70] Todd McCarthy remarked that the "capable" Gosling and McGregor "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before".[71] The film grossed $8 million worldwide.[72] Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: "I had a kid come up to me on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if they say I made them cry."[73]

Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher.[74] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described it as "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage."[75] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and asserted that "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance".[76] Roger Ebert believed that his performance "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies."[77] Gosling garnered a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.[21] The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office.[78] In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[79]

Gosling played an introvert who falls for a sex doll in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey.[80] Roger Ebert felt "a film about a life-sized love doll" had been turned into "a life-affirming statement of hope" because of "a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said".[81] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes."[82] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career."[83] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.[84][85] The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget.[86]

Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on.[87] Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person.[88] He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role.[89] Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is worth the price of admission".[90] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma."[91] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.[92]

Gosling was scheduled to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of "creative differences" and was replaced by Mark Wahlberg.[93] Gosling was cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes.[94] Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds (27 kilograms) in weight and grew a beard to appear older.[94] Walsh then "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what."[94] Gosling later said, "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed."[94] He has said the experience was "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role."[95]

2010–2012: Widespread recognition
Following a three-year absence from the screen, Gosling starred in five films in 2010 and 2011. "I've never had more energy," Gosling said. "I'm more excited to make films than I used to be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so emotional and taxing. But I've found a way to have fun while doing it. And I think that translates into the films."[33] He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working.[20] In 2010, he starred opposite Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, the marital drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said "you had to remind yourself you were making a film".[96] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance"[97] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him to be "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version".[98] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that he "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful."[99] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance was an example of "hipsterism misdirected".[100] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.[101] The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million.[102]

Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir David Marks, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst).[103] Gosling found the filming process to be a "dark experience" and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film.[104] When asked if he was proud of the film, he said, "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie."[104] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that he "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings."[105] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man".[106] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but praised Gosling's performance.[107] The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.[108] Also in 2010, Gosling narrated and produced ReGeneration, a documentary that explores the cynicism in today's youth towards social and political causes.[109][110]


Gosling in 2011
2011 saw Gosling expand his horizons by appearing in three diverse, high-profile roles. He co-starred in his first comedic role in the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, with Steve Carell and Emma Stone.[111] Gosling took cocktail-making classes at a Los Angeles bar in preparation for his role as a smooth-talking ladies' man.[112] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said his "seductive command presence suggests we may have found our next George Clooney".[113] Peter Travers declared him "a comic knockout"[114] while Claudia Puig of USA Today felt he reveals a "surprising" "knack for comedy."[115] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[116] The film was a box office success, grossing over $142 million worldwide.[117] With adjustments for inflation, it is the second most successful of Gosling's career.[61]

Gosling's first action role was in Drive, based on a novel by James Sallis.[118] Gosling played a Hollywood stunt performer who moonlights as a getaway driver, and he has described the film as a "violent John Hughes movie": "I always thought if Pretty in Pink had head-smashing it would be perfect".[119] Roger Ebert compared Gosling to Steve McQueen and stated that he "embodies presence and sincerity ... he has shown a gift for finding arresting, powerful characters [and] can achieve just about anything.[120] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal pondered "the ongoing mystery of how he manages to have so much impact with so little apparent effort. It's irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando."[121] The film was a box office success, grossing $81 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.[122]

In his final appearance of 2011, Gosling co-starred with Philip Seymour Hoffman in the political drama The Ides of March directed by George Clooney, in which he played an ambitious press secretary.[123] Gosling partly decided to do the film to become more politically aware: "I'm Canadian and so American politics aren't really in my wheelhouse."[124] Joe Morganstern stated that Gosling and Hoffman "are eminently well equipped to play variations on their characters' main themes. Yet neither actor has great material to conjure with in the script."[125] In a generally tepid review, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times asserted that it was "certainly involving to see the charismatic Gosling verbally spar with superb character actors like Hoffman and [Paul] Giamatti."[126] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt there was "one aspect to the character that Gosling can't quite nail down, that might simply be outside his sphere, which is idealism."[127] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.[116] The film grossed $66 million worldwide.[128]

2013–2014: Mixed critical reception and directorial debut

Gosling at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival
In 2013's crime thriller Gangster Squad, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD officer who attempts to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid, Love. Stone has said she hopes they will find more projects to work together on.[129] A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as an excuse for the cast "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess."[130] Christy Lemire of The Boston Globe criticized Gosling's "weird, whispery voice" and his "barely developed, one-note" character.[131] However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that there was "a seductive power" in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: "But like too much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out."[132]

In The Place Beyond the Pines, a generational drama directed by Blue Valentine's Derek Cianfrance,[133] Gosling played Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks to provide for his family.[134] The shoot was described by Gosling as "the best experience I have ever had making a film."[26] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised his performance, writing: "Mr. Gosling's cool self-possession — the only thing he was allowed to display in "Drive" — is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability."[135] Scott Foundas of The Village Voice was unimpressed: "Gosling's character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on ... It's a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn's existential Hollywood thriller, Drive, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction."[136] David Denby of The New Yorker remarked that he "reprises his inexorable-loner routine".[137] The film grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.[138]

Later in 2013, Gosling starred in the violent revenge drama Only God Forgives,[139] directed by Drive's Nicolas Winding Refn. Gosling undertook Muay Thai training in preparation for the role,[140] and has described the script as "the strangest thing I've ever read".[140] Both the film and his performance drew negative reviews.[141][142][143] David Edelstein of New York magazine stated, "Gosling looked like a major actor as a skinhead in The Believer and a star in Half Nelson. Then he stopped acting and started posing. His performance in Only God Forgives (would God forgive that title?) is one long, moist stare".[144] Stephen Holden of the New York Times criticized Gosling's inability "to give his automaton any suggestion of an inner life".[145] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commented that Gosling, while "meant to be a blank page for us to write on, often looks merely blank".[146]

In early 2013, Gosling announced that he was taking a break from acting, stating, "I've lost perspective on what I'm doing. I think it's good for me to take a break and reassess why I'm doing it and how I'm doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that."[147] Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.[148] The "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith.[149][150] The film received largely unfavorable reviews.[151] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it "insufferably conceited" and remarked that Gosling had lost "any sense of proportion or humility."[152] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described Lost River as "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself",[153] while Variety's Justin Chang dismissed the "derivative" film as a "train-wreck."[154]

2015–present: Established actor

Gosling at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con
In 2015, Gosling played a bond salesman in the ensemble financial satire The Big Short, a Best Picture nominee at the 2016 Academy Awards. David Sims of The Atlantic felt that he was "smarmily funny, somehow simultaneously magnetic and repulsive; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema, it's wonderful to see him cut loose again."[155] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: "Gosling, a virtuoso of verbal sleaze, talks directly to the camera, and he's volcanically fierce and funny."[156] The following year, Gosling starred in the black comedy The Nice Guys, opposite Russell Crowe,[157] and in Damien Chazelle's musical La La Land, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and received his second Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.[158] Robbie Collin praised his chemistry with co-star Emma Stone, writing: "Both stars are so attuned to each other's pace and flow that their repartee just seems to tumble out, perfectly formed."[159] It emerged as one of his most commercially successful films, with earnings of over $440 million against its $30 million budget.[160]

Gosling was signed on to work with Terrence Malick in 2004 on the biographical film Che, but later dropped out.[161][162] He made an appearance in Malick's Song to Song (2017), which co-starred Christian Bale and Cate Blanchett.[163][164] Also in 2017, he starred in Blade Runner 2049, a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, directed by Denis Villeneuve and co-starring Harrison Ford, who reprised his role as Rick Deckard. Gosling's role was as Officer K, a "blade runner" working for the LAPD whose job it is to kill rogue bioengineered humans known as replicants.[165] A. O. Scott found him to be perfectly cast, adding that his "ability to elicit sympathy while seeming too distracted to want it – his knack for making boredom look like passion and vice versa – makes him a perfect warm-blooded robot for our time".[166] Despite being Gosling's largest box office opening, grossing $31.5 million domestically, the film generally underperformed at the box office.[167]

In 2018, Gosling portrayed Neil Armstrong, the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon in 1969, in Chazelle's biopic First Man, based on the book First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong.[168] Writing for IndieWire, Michael Nordine commended him for bringing "quiet charisma" and "grace" to his role, while Nicholas Barber of the BBC hailed him as the "best deadpan actor in the business".[169][170] He received a nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor.[171]

After a four-year break from film, Gosling returned starring in the 2022 spy-action thriller The Gray Man, opposite Chris Evans and Ana de Armas.[172] The film had a limited theatrical release and was distributed by Netflix. Despite negative reviews from critics, who described the film as "mediocre" and full of cliches, a sequel has been announced and is in development.[173][174] In the following year, Gosling starred as Ken in Greta Gerwig's fantasy comedy Barbie, opposite Margot Robbie in the title role.[175] He also sang the song "I'm Just Ken" for the film's accompanying soundtrack as well as a cover of "Push" by Matchbox Twenty.[176][177] His performance has received overwhelmingly positive reviews, with Anthony Lane of The New Yorker lauding his comedic performance as "peak Gosling",[178] and Vulture's Alison Willmore wrote that he "comes close to stealing the movie".[179] He received Golden Globe, Critics' Choice, SAG, BAFTA, and Academy Award nominations for his performance.

Gosling will next star in the action comedy film The Fall Guy alongside Emily Blunt.[180][181]

Music career
Main article: Dead Man's Bones

In 2007, Gosling made a solo recording called "Put Me in the Car" available for download on the Internet.[182] Also that year, Gosling and his friend Zach Shields formed the indie rock band Dead Man's Bones. The two first met in 2005 when Gosling was dating Rachel McAdams and Shields was dating her sister, Kayleen.[183][184] They initially conceived of the project as a monster-themed musical but settled on forming a band when they realized putting on a stage production would be too expensive.[183] They recorded their eponymous debut album with the Silverlake Conservatory's Children's Choir and learned to play all the instruments themselves.[183] Gosling contributed vocals, piano, guitar, bass guitar and cello to the record.[184] The album was released through ANTI- Records on October 6, 2009.[185] Pitchfork Media was won over by the "unique, catchy and lovably weird record"[186] while Prefix felt the album was "rarely kitschy and never inappropriate".[187] However, Spin felt the album "doesn't reverse the rule that actors make dubious pop musicians"[188] and Entertainment Weekly criticized its "cloying, gothic preciousness".[189]

In September 2009, Gosling and Shields had a three-night residency at LA's Bob Baker Marionette Theater where they performed alongside dancing neon skeletons and glowing ghosts.[184][190] They then conducted a thirteen-date tour of North America in October 2009, using a local children's choir at every show.[191][192] Instead of an opening act, a talent show was held each night.[193] In September 2010, they performed at Los Angeles' FYF Festival. In 2011, the actor spoke of his intentions to record a second Dead Man's Bones album. No children's choir will be featured on the follow-up album because "it's not very rock 'n' roll".[194]

Personal life

Gosling at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival
Gosling previously resided in New York City.[16][195] He co-owns Tagine, a Moroccan restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.[196] He bought the restaurant on an impulse; he said he spent "all [his] money" on it,[197] spent a year doing the renovation work himself, and now oversees the restaurant's menus.[197][198]

Gosling dated his Murder by Numbers co-star Sandra Bullock from 2002 to 2003.[199] He then had a relationship with his The Notebook co-star Rachel McAdams from 2005 to 2007;[200] they briefly reunited in 2008.[201][202]

Gosling has been in a relationship with his The Place Beyond the Pines co-star Eva Mendes since September 2011.[203] They have two daughters, born in 2014 and 2016.[204][205]

Charity work
Gosling supports various social causes. He has worked with PETA to encourage KFC and McDonald's to use improved methods of chicken slaughter, and on a campaign encouraging dairy farmers to stop de-horning cows.[206][207][208]

In 2005, Gosling volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi in the clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina.[209]

He is a supporter of Invisible Children, Inc., a group that raises awareness about the LRA in Central Africa.[210] In 2005, he traveled to Darfur refugee camps in Chad.[21][211] He was a speaker at Campus Progress' National Conference in 2008, where he discussed Darfur.[212] As part of his work with the Enough Project, he visited Uganda in 2007[213] and eastern Congo in 2010.[214]

Among his many accolades, Gosling has received three Academy Award nominations, two British Academy Film Award nomination, one Golden Globe Award from six nominations, and six Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.

In 2006, his role as a troubled history teacher in the drama film Half Nelson gained him nominations for an Academy Award[215] and Screen Actors Guild Award[216] for Best Actor. He received nominations for an Academy Award,[217] British Academy Film Award,[218] Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award[219] for La La Land (2016) and Barbie (2023) in the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories respectively, winning a Golden Globe Award for the former. His performances in Lars and the Real Girl (2007),[220] Blue Valentine (2010),[221] The Ides of March, and Crazy, Stupid, Love (both 2011);[222] also earned him Golden Globe nominations.
Dune (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One) is a 2021 American epic science fiction film directed and co-produced by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth. It is the first of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. Set in the distant future, the film follows Paul Atreides as his family, the noble House Atreides, is thrust into a war for the deadly and inhospitable desert planet Arrakis. The ensemble cast includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem.

The film is the third adaptation of Dune, following David Lynch's 1984 film and John Harrison's 2000 television miniseries. After an unsuccessful attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation, Legendary Pictures acquired the Dune film and television rights in 2016, with Villeneuve signing on as director in February 2017. Production contracts were secured only for the first film, relying on its success before a sequel would be produced. Principal photography took place from March to July 2019 at locations including Budapest, Jordan, Norway, and Abu Dhabi.

Dune was scheduled for a late 2020 release but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2021, before its international release on September 15, 2021; it was then released in United States theaters and streaming on HBO Max on October 22, 2021. Dune was a box office success, grossing $435 million on a $165 million budget, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2021. It was well received by critics and audiences with praise for Villeneuve's direction, screenplay, production values, Hans Zimmer's musical score, cinematography, and managing to retain core elements from the source material. The film won six awards at the 94th Academy Awards and was nominated in four other categories, including Best Picture, in addition to receiving numerous other accolades. The continuation, Dune: Part Two, was released in March 2024.

Plot
In the distant future, Duke Leto Atreides, ruler of the planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as the fiefholder of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and sole source of "spice", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is also key to interstellar travel, giving Spacing Guild Navigators the ability to guide starships to traverse space instantaneously and safely. Shaddam, fearful of Leto's rising power, plots for House Harkonnen to retake Arrakis, secretly aided by his Sardaukar troops, and destroy House Atreides. Leto is suspicious of the Emperor but weighs the risks against the power of controlling Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, the Fremen.

Leto's concubine, Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit — an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of their centuries-long breeding program, they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach — a Bene Gesserit and messianic superbeing with the clairvoyance necessary to guide humanity to a better future. Jessica disobeyed and bore a son, Paul, who is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and the Mentat Thufir Hawat; she teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan about his troubling visions of the future. The Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam visits Caladan and subjects him to a death-alternative gom jabbar test to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes. At a secret meeting on Giedi Prime, Mohiam insists Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica in his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.

House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, the fortress stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan's advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which she explains is due to the Bene Gesserit sowing beliefs on Arrakis centuries earlier. Leto negotiates with Fremen chieftain Stilgar and meets the Imperial Judge of the Change, Dr. Kynes, a planetologist who lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers of spice harvesting, and the giant sandworms which travel under the desert and make the use of protective Holtzman shields unwise. During a flight, they rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm, and Paul's exposure to the spice triggers intense premonitions.

An attempt to assassinate Paul with a hunter-seeker fails. Yueh betrays the Atreides and disables Arrakeen's shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade. He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, who is the Baron's prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule with which the Duke can assassinate the Baron. After the Baron double-crosses and murders Yueh, Leto releases the gas, killing himself and the Baron's Mentat, Piter De Vries, but the Baron survives. Though the Baron has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate Yueh has left them with a fremkit with survival supplies. Jessica uses a Bene Gesserit technique called "the Voice" to overpower and kill their captors. Overnighting in the desert, Paul—surrounded by spice—has visions of a bloody holy war fought across the universe in his name.

After conquering Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen appoints his nephew Rabban to oversee the planet and orders him to restart spice production to recoup the invasion's cost. Meanwhile, Duncan and Kynes find Jessica and Paul, who discloses his plan to marry one of Emperor Shaddam's daughters to avert a potential civil war arising from the Emperor's betrayal. However, they are discovered by Sardaukar soldiers armed with a lasgun. Duncan sacrifices himself, enabling Paul and Jessica's escape. Kynes also tries to escape but is caught and mortally wounded by the Sardaukar. She lures a sandworm to her location to devour herself and the Sardaukar. Deep in the desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's Fremen tribe, including Chani, the young woman from Paul's visions. Opposed to Stilgar's lenience towards them, Fremen warrior Jamis challenges Paul to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul wins. Despite Jessica's wishes, Paul joins the Fremen, determined to fulfill his father's goal of allying with them to bring Arrakis peace.

Production
Background
See also: Dune (novel) § Adaptations, and Dune (franchise)
Following the publication of Frank Herbert's novel Dune in 1965, it was considered as having potential for a possible film adaptation. Since 1971, various producers have held film adaptation rights for the novel. Attempts to make an adaptation based on the book were considered to be "unfilmable" due to its breadth of content.[7][8][9] The book's status among fans meant that deviations without strong justification could potentially harm the film's reputation.[10]

Alejandro Jodorowsky acquired the rights in the 1970s to make a fourteen-hour adaptation of the book, but the project ultimately failed to secure sufficient funds. This development effort became the subject of the documentary film Jodorowsky's Dune (2013).[11] David Lynch's Dune, produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis in 1984, was intended as a three-hour film but was cut to 137 minutes; it was poorly received and Lynch himself ended up disowning it.[10][12] In 1996, producer Richard P. Rubinstein acquired the rights to the novel. Frank Herbert's Dune, a live-action miniseries produced by Rubinstein and directed by John Harrison, aired on the Sci Fi Channel in 2000; it was a ratings hit and was generally better received than Lynch's film. Some reviewers criticized the miniseries for lacking the spectacle afforded to a feature film production, as well as for staying too faithful to the book and being bogged down by exposition.[13][14] Prospects to make a successful adaptation of Dune improved after the critical and commercial success of the film series adaptations of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, both of which maintained most of the works' key characters and plots while managing the limited running time.[10] In 2008, Paramount Pictures hired Peter Berg to direct an adaptation.[15] Berg left the project in October 2009,[16] with director Pierre Morel being hired in January 2010.[17] Paramount later cancelled the project in March 2011, as they could not come to key agreements, with their rights reverting to Rubinstein.[18][19]

Development

Denis Villeneuve said that adapting Dune was a lifelong ambition. He was hired to direct in February 2017.
In 2011, Mary Parent, vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Pictures, and her producer partner Cale Boyter, acquired adaptation rights for Dune.[20] Legendary obtained film and TV rights for Dune in November 2016.[21][22] Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve expressed interest in the project in September 2016, saying that "a longstanding dream of mine is to adapt Dune, but it's a long process to get the rights, and I don't think I will succeed".[23] By December, Villeneuve was in talks with the studio to direct the film.[24] His enthusiasm to direct a Dune film earned Parent's respect, with Parent hiring Villeneuve after hearing him describe his vision for the film. He chose to complete Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017) first, as he wanted to spend more time to develop Dune and co-write it himself, employing his past experience directing science fiction films during development.[20][25] Villeneuve signed on to direct the film by January 2017, approximately one week after earning a nomination Academy Award for Best Director for Arrival.[26] By that February, Villeneuve was officially confirmed as the director.[27]

Some of Villeneuve's previous collaborators on Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 returned for Dune, including film editor Joe Walker,[28] production designer Patrice Vermette, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert, sound designer and editor Theo Green, sound editor Mark Mangini,[29] and special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer.[30] Other previous collaborators were slated to work on Dune but dropped out before production began, including visual effects supervisor John Nelson[31] and cinematographer Roger Deakins, who was replaced in December 2018 with Greig Fraser.[32] Dune was produced by Villeneuve, Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant.[33][34] Game of Thrones language creator David J. Peterson was confirmed as a constructed language developer for the film in April 2019.[35]

Writing
In March 2018, Villeneuve stated that his goal was to adapt the novel into a two-part film series.[36] He secured a two-movie deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaptation of Stephen King's It in 2017 and in 2019. He chose to make two films as he felt that the novel was too large and complex for one.[37] Subsequent dealings secured the production of the first film and new production deals were made to start production for the second.[38] Eric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in April, [39] with Legendary CEO Joshua Grode affirming that the studio planned on making a sequel.[40] Roth, who had read the book as a child, had a neutral opinion of it, which allowed him to have an "objective view of it". He wrote a 50-page treatment for the film and focused on appealing to groups of people who enjoyed the book, did not remember nor care for the book, and those who were not familiar with it at all.[41] Villeneuve completed a first draft of the script by May 2018,[42][43] Producer Brian Herbert stated that the fourth draft of the screenplay, submitted in July, would cover the first half of the events from the novel,[44] while Jon Spaihts was later hired as co-writer alongside Roth and Villeneuve in September.[45] Though the book features many elements inspired from Arab and Islamic culture, Spaihts stated the team minimized incorporating them as he felt Arab culture became integrated into the world, resulting in the need to "invent more and borrow less" due to potentially overemphasizing them.[46] Eventually, Roth worked on the film again after completing his work on Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), providing feedback after a screening of the film and aiding in rewrites prior to reshoots.[41]

When writing his script, Villeneuve chose not to take inspiration from Lynch's Dune, wanting instead to directly refer to the book despite affirming his respect for Lynch and the film.[47] He described his reaction to the film as being "half-satisfied", and felt he would make the film with a "different sensibility".[48] Similarly, he chose not to incorporate concepts Jodorowsky envisioned for his Dune film, as he felt it would be "very presumptuous and arrogant".[49][50] He was not intimidated by previous film adaptations as he felt his love for Dune allowed him to focus on his own vision. He compared his experience of making the film to archaeology, describing the process as "going back in time and finding those images mixed with emotions, and bringing them back to life".[20]

In adapting the book for a contemporary audience, Villeneuve considered his screenplay "a coming-of-age story, but also a call for action for the youth" and noted the book's social commentary regarding capitalism and the exploitation of natural resources such as oil.[37] In doing so, Villeneuve wanted to recreate the experience he had felt when he initially read the book as a teen.[51] He adjusted and modified many parts of the novel for the film, and wanted to keep "the atmosphere and poetry ... intact".[52] This included eliminating internal monologues and epigraphs used in the book and simplifying the "pseudo-antiquated" dialogue.[20] Instead, he emphasized Paul and Jessica's relationship as the main focus of the story, and gave them a secret hand gesture language they could use to communicate silently to each other. The film also minimizes the political aspects of the Dune world in order to retain the book's scale and exploration of power dynamics while also focus on Paul's growth.[52] The inclusion of the informative holographic filmbook videos for Paul was adapted from the book, with Villeneuve wanting it to convey Paul's "appetite for learning" and his desire to learn about the Arrakis and Fremen culture.[51]

Some characters were given less prominence, such as Baron Harkonnen, members of his court, and the Mentats Thufir Hawat and Piter De Vries, but established enough so that they can be used in the future.[52] Villeneuve sought to depict the Baron as a complex antagonist rather than as a caricature, feeling the novel presented him as being the latter, and took inspiration from Colonel Kurtz.[37][51] Another major change was altering some of the arcs of the female characters in the book to give them more respect and prominence, as Villeneuve felt femininity was a crucial theme in the book.[52] Ferguson stated that while Villeneuve respected Herbert's characterization in the book, Villeneuve's modifications had helped improve the quality of female characters by expanding the role of Lady Jessica as an expanded role as a soldier and member of the Bene Gesserit. As such, the studio labeled this role a "warrior priestess", in contrast to the joking label of "space nun" that Villeneuve felt was implied by the book.[37]

(Stilgar)

Stellan Skarsgård
(Baron Vladimir Harkonnen)
Villeneuve began the casting process by first determining who would portray Paul Atreides. He approached actors on an individual basis and felt the final cast was close to his "dream list".[53] For Paul, Villeneuve desired an actor who had "an old soul in the body of a teenager". He identified Timothée Chalamet as the ideal choice for the role, later admitting that he had no alternate choices in mind.[54][55] Chalamet, who previously auditioned for a role in Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013),[26] also desired to collaborate with Villeneuve and appear in Dune. He travelled to the Cannes Film Festival to discuss the role with Villeneuve.[26][56] Chalamet entered final negotiations to play the role of Paul in July 2018.[57][58] Rebecca Ferguson entered negotiations that September to play the role of Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, with Chalamet already confirmed for the role of Paul.[45] Ferguson was initially dismissive as the role, as she felt it was too similar to her Mission: Impossible role as Ilsa Faust. Ferguson did not want to be typecast as a "strong female character".[59] However, she was convinced after hearing Villeneuve's ideas and reading the book, saying she enjoyed the "simplicity of wanting to save something you have created and all of these shades".[60] She had been cast by January 2019.[61]

Casting director Francine Maisler had compiled over 30–50 audition tapes from actors for Villeneuve to decide from when casting secondary roles.[62] Dave Bautista was offered the role of Glossu Rabban following a phone call from Villeneuve. He was an avid fan of Villeneuve and wanted to contact him, but was surprised when Villeneuve contacted him first and proud of being offered the role.[63] Villeneuve wanted Stellan Skarsgård to portray Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as he had found Skarsgård intimidating, and personally contacted Charlotte Rampling in order to portray Gaius Helen Mohiam, who accepted as she enjoyed Villeneuve's work.[64] Oscar Isaac contacted Villeneuve about starring in the film once he heard it was in development. Villeneuve cast him as Duke Leto, with Isaac commenting the role suited him physically. Zendaya auditioned for the role of Chani alongside five other actresses. She was chosen as she was considered to have the best performance with Chalamet.[62] Bautista,[65] Skarsgård,[66] Rampling,[67] Isaac,[68] and Zendaya all joined the cast in January 2019.[69]

In the next month, Javier Bardem,[70] Josh Brolin,[71] Jason Momoa,[72] and David Dastmalchian were all cast as Stilgar, Gurney Halleck, Duncan Idaho, and Piter de Vries, respectively.[73] Villeneuve directly called Bardem and offered him the role, who was shocked as he wanted to portray Stilgar, comparing it to his personal love for Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings. Meanwhile, Brolin amusingly commented that he pretended to read the script prior to accepting the role, while Momoa received his casting call when he was snowboarding down a mountain. He later contacted Villeneuve on a Skype call to confirm his involvement.[56] Dastmalchian's casting was similar to Brolin and Momoa's, as he received a call while he was in his Los Angeles home, and accepted the role without reading the script due to his confidence in Villeneuve.[74] Stephen McKinley Henderson joined in March,[34] with Chang Chen entering negotiations.[34][75] Maisler chose Henderson after admiring his work in New York theaters, and curated a list of the "most talented" Chinese actors for the role of Dr. Yueh. Despite initial difficulties contacting Chen, they eventually contacted his manager in China. Afterwards, Chen accepted his role as Dr. Yueh. The decision to cast Benjamin Clementine as the Herald of the Change occurred after Maisler enjoyed his performance in the Tiny Desk Concerts.[62]

In July 2019, it was reported that the film would "gender swap" the character Liet-Kynes by casting Sharon Duncan-Brewster for the role.[76] Duncan-Brewster auditioned for the role in London through Jina Jay, a casting director working with Maisler at the time, saying that she "exudes an intelligence and a power and an inner strength". When Maisler presented a shortlist for potential cast members, Villeneuve selected Duncan-Brewster.[62] Her casting was confirmed in April 2020.[37] The idea to change Kynes' gender was suggested by Jon Spaihts, which Villeneuve promptly accepted.[52] According to Duncan-Brewster, Villeneuve opted for the change as he felt it was not necessary to adhere to all of the elements in the book in order to remain faithful to the character's nature.[38]

Design
Set and props
The set design was done by production designer Patrice Vermette.[77] Vermette based the set design for Dune by the need "to ground the story into realistic settings to help the audience believe in the extraordinary elements". He sought to make the sets as realistic and immersive as possible, using minimal set extensions and no greenscreens.[20][78] Prior to the creation of any sets or visual effects, Villeneuve and a group of specific people, worked together to define the visual language for the film.[20]

Vermette created a "visual bible" to guide the development of set design and keep it consistent with the film's visual effects design, intending to help "extrapolate the world". He also re-read the novel, as he felt that "the book gives a lot of clues or cues that will help you navigate it to design things, but it's quite nonspecific", adding that he wanted to support Villeneuve's original vision of the novel when he read it as a young teenager, and base the design around Herbert's original novel.[78][79][80] The team's early mood boards for the visual language of the film consisted of Mesopotamian ziggurat architecture, Egyptian references, World War II bunkers, Brazilian and Soviet brutalist architecture, minimalist megastructures and dams designed by Superstudio, and imagery of glaciers taking over mountains.[20]

The design for the ornithopters was conceived by Villeneuve and storyboard artist Sam Hudecki. Villeneuve wanted the ornithopter be "muscular"; he wanted it to resemble a dragonfly and helicopter, but also appear realistic and adhere to basic laws of science. This fit in with his overall perception of the Dune world being retro-futuristic and analog. He also wanted the cockpits to be designed so that the actors could see the landscape. Two functional ornithopter models, 48- and 75-feet long, were created for filming by London propmakers, with operable doors and interior cockpit areas. They weighed over 11 tons and required an Antonov cargo plane to transport them to filming locations in Hungary and Jordan. One ornithopter used in filming had customizable pieces allowing for more space. Cranes were used to make the models fly.[81][82]

Many practical sets were created on the soundstages and backlots of the Origo Film Studios in Budapest, Hungary, serving as interiors for the three planets. When designing Caladan, Vermette sought to give the planet "a feeling of melancholia". He wanted Caladan to resemble autumn in Canada, his home country, as he thought that it represented "the end of a cycle... or the beginning of a new one". He identified "dramatic coastal mountain ranges" and forests containing Norwegian pines as defining features of the planet.[78] Meanwhile, the interior sets of Caladan were inspired by medieval Japanese aesthetics, particularly that of Paul's training room, containing intricate screens and diffused lighting. Props were created by set decorator Richard Roberts, including custom-made furniture, lighting, textiles produced in Denmark, and other items designed to look antique.[81]

The original design for the sandworm was deemed "prehistoric", inspired by whales with baleen in their mouths.[83] The sandworm's skin texture was based on tree bark and mud flats. Vermette spoke of the challenges involved in creating the set designs used for the sandworms, stating "It was a creature that commanded respect, and it’s almost seen as a deity in the world of the Fremen. So that’s why the first time you see the depiction of the sand worm on the mural, it’s presented with sun coming out of its mouth".[84]

The design for Arrakeen was influenced by the book's description of Arrakis's climate, with Vermette calling it "the biggest residency ever built by humankind" and "a response as a colonial entity that took over the planet for the exploitation of ... spice". He designed the city in a "rock bowl" shape to protect its infrastructure from sandworms, and built buildings at an angle to protect them from high wind speeds. The walls were thickened to make the interiors cooler. The team was inspired by WWII bunkers, bunkers, Mayan temples, and Brazilian modernism. The history and culture of the Fremen was depicted in various murals throughout the residence, with Vermette comparing it to that of a church after envisioning Fremen artists doing so in order to depict the colonization of Arrakis.[20][80][84] One practical set was the environmental lab in which Sardaukar soldiers descend from the air. The circular dome was 20 feet high, with the spokes being created by a special kind of cloth fabric, giving the illusion of shadows and providing proper lighting for the act. Agriculturally controlled sand was placed on the ground as filming took place during Budapest's raining season.[79]

Costumes
Over 1000 looks for Arrakis, Caladan, and Giedi Prime were designed by the team for the film.[85] The costume design was done by Jacqueline West and Bob Morgan. Villeneuve wanted the costumes to be "grounded" in history while avoiding conventional futuristic views in science fiction films.[86][87] West performed "psychological studies" of characters and historical research to associate their houses with historical "symbolic analogs", facilitating her costume design process. She took primary inspiration from the Middle Ages, particularly envisioning what it would look like in the future. She associated the Fremen with the French Resistance and the Sardaukar with the Nazis when designing the costumes. Additionally, she took inspiration from Giotto, Francisco Goya, Caravaggio, and British art historian John Berger, while emulating styles from the fashion of Balenciaga, the Bedouin, and Tuareg people.[86][85]

West associated the Spacing Guild with the Avignon Papacy, connected their persecution of the Templars to that of House Atreides; she noted that the Emperor and his allies betrayed House Atreides. Reference pictures consisted of medieval popes and modernized it when designing their costumes.[86] The Bene Gesserit sorceresses' costumes were based on tarot cards and chess pieces, while the Harkonnen armor was designed to resemble a bug's shell, using medieval drawings of "insects, spiders, ants, praying mantises and lizards" as reference.[88] Meanwhile, the Atreides' costumes were based on the Romanovs, describing their costumes as having a "simplicity ... that was regal".[89] Lady Jessica's dresses in the first half of the film were inspired by the works of Cristóbal Balenciaga, while the turmeric-toned gown she wears while landing on Arrakis was influenced by Middle Eastern clothing and paintings of women in North Africa.[20][86]

West cited the films Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), and Fahrenheit 451 (1966) as further inspirations for costume diversity. She also researched Roman and Greek mythology, feeling that the Atreides-Harkonnen feud was similar to a "real Greek and Roman tragedy". She dyed the gauze for Fremen cloth in desert colors, inspired by the sand and rocks in Jordanian filming locations.[85] A prototype for the stillsuit was designed by West and Jose Fernandez at Ironhead Studios in Los Angeles. The prototype was then taken to Origo Studios, where a factory was set up to design additional suits within two weeks. He hired European artisans to create concept designs and over 150 individual pieces for the suits. Over 250 stillsuits were used when filming in Jordan. The suits were designed to be flexible and comfortably fit the actor's body, while also remaining accurate to the book. They created "micro-sandwiches" of acrylic fibers and porous cottons, which absorbed the moisture and allowed the actors to remain cool inside the suits. Tubing also ran through the micro-sandwiches for increased flexibility. Zippers and buttons were not used as they were deemed "archaic".[86][85][88]

Filming
Principal photography began on March 18, 2019, at Origo Film Studios in Budapest, Hungary, with Greig Fraser serving as cinematographer.[28][34][90] The film was shot for the IMAX format with an IMAX-certified Arri Alexa LF camera and an IMAX-certified Alexa Mini LF prototype, equipped with Panavision's large-format lenses in the Ultra Vista and H-series lineup. Select scenes had aspect ratios opened up to 1.90:1 on all IMAX screens, and to 1.43:1 on select IMAX screens outfitted with IMAX's dual-laser projection system. The finished footage was transferred to 35mm film stock, then scanned back to 4K, in order to achieve a more film-like look.[91][92] Filming occurred in Wadi Rum, Jordan, which doubled for Arrakis.[34][93][94] The Liwa Oasis in the United Arab Emirates also served as a key backdrop for Arrakis, with filming there occurring across 11 days. Local businesses, freelancers from Twofour54, and crews consisting of over 100 people offered assistance during the shoot.[95][96][97] Scenes featuring the rock formations functioning as the Fremens' heat shelters were filmed at the Rub' al Khali desert.[98] Stadlandet, Norway doubled for the planet Caladan.[99] Filming wrapped on July 26, 2019.[100][101] Additional filming took place in Budapest by August 2020, which did not alter the film's then-December 2020 release date.[102][103]

Parts of the Arrakeen invasion, such as shots of Gurney, extras, and practical explosions up to approximately five kilometers high, were filmed on backlots in Budapest.[104] Duke Leto's death scene was the final scene filmed by Isaac, in which he decided to film it nude as he felt it was similar to Christ's crucifixion. He also came up with the idea of including the bull's head, identifying it as an "omen".[105] Ornithopter interiors were filmed on hilltops outside Budapest, with a 25-foot high and 360° sand-colored ramp circling a large gimbal, allowing Fraser to film with natural sunlight.[106][107] Supervising stunt coordinator and second unit director Tom Struthers developed unique combat styles for major factions. When working on the action sequence between Idaho and the Sardaukars, he based Idaho's combat style from Greek and Roman warfare techniques, and the Sardaukar's from Russian soldiers in WWII wanting to "mow down the enemy".[108] Chalamet learned the sandwalking technique, designed by choreographer Benjamin Millepied, prior to filming Arrakis scenes in order to convey Paul's natural adeptness at it and "responsibility to show Jessica in that moment".[109] Footage of helicopters flying over the UAE were filmed with six high-resolution cameras, being utilized as reference footage for ornithopters.[107][110]

Post-production

"Sandscreens" were used to simulate the natural luminance of the desert intended for backgrounds.[111]
DNEG contributed to over 28 scenes in the film, creating 1,200 VFX shots out of the 1,700 total, with vendors including Wylie Co. and Rodeo FX.[112][113] Many shots used various chroma key processes. Visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert used "sandscreens" for filming scenes in Arrakis and Arrakeen; instead of using green-based backgrounds, the visual effects team used sand-colored ones that matched the establishing desert shots intended for backgrounds. The sandscreens were used in capturing scenes of the ornithopter, with the VFX team using the helicopter footage and replacing them with the ornithopter models, facilitating capture of sand displacement. This was also filmed by encapsulating ornithopter models in black boxes with fans blowing dust. The wings were inserted using computer-generated imagery (CGI).[110][83][111] Similar processes were used to film scenes in other settings, as it facilitated compositing the foreground and background imagery: Caladan scenes used "grayscreens" and those with a "slight blue tint" for interior and exterior scenes, respectively, Salusa Secundus scenes used bluescreens.[106][83][114] Approximately 18 tons of sand and dust were used on set, with the effect of blowing sand being created by using a V8 engine with a fan on the back of a tractor.[115]

The sandworms were created through CGI. The VFX team found a lot of difficulty in deciding how the sandworm would move. The team spent over a year in figuring out the movements of the sandworm, and researched the body movements of various animals, such as worms and snakes. The sand ripples created by the worms were inspired by Jaws (1975).[116] The special-effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer designed a vibrating 8x8 foot steel plate and placed it under the sand. This resulted in the formation of various patterns, used to signify an approaching sandworm. The vibrating areas were also later enhanced to cover a larger area.[106][107] The team initially considered using rigged explosives to capture the motion of the sandworms breaking the surface in the desert, but rejected the idea as this was impractical to perform in the Middle East. Instead, they used the Houdini software to have sand emulate the motion of water. Villeneuve did not want the associated sound design to appear as a studio production. Sound designers Mark Mangini and Theo Green used a "fake documentary realism" approach to capture natural sounds and manipulate them for use in the film, such as recording the sounds of shifting sands in Death Valley using hydrophones.[83]

The Montreal and Vancouver facilities of DNEG were used for the Arrakeen invasion sequence. It involved the combination of practical and digital effects. The VFX supervisor of the Montreal team, Brian Connor, created a digital Arrakeen space port, while the Vancouver team was tasked with simulating the explosions. Practical explosions filmed in the Budapest backlots were later enhanced by the VFX team, as the special effects team had rigs of practical light shining through the fog from the practical explosions. This allowed the VFX team to then blend the practical and digital shots together easier.[104] Lambert created the visual effects for the shields by combining past and future frames after experimenting with a clip from Seven Samurai (1954), which resulted in a "shimmering" look Villeneuve approved. They also added colors; they used blue for when an object bounces and red for when it penetrates. The scene of Paul's future vision was filmed using motion-capture (mo-cap), and the team replicated the mo-cap to add hundreds of fighters to the scene. Animation supervisor Robyn Luckham helped create the scene as the team did not know much about mo-cap. They also added explosions in the foreground, sandworms in the background, sand displacement throughout the scenes, and used more simulations to render the scene in real-time.[107] To create the desert mouse, Muad'Dib, the team created a detailed practical stuffy model, and filmed it in Jordan for the appropriate desert lighting. The animation team used footage of animals idling as reference, and animated the mouse so that it "only expends effort when absolutely necessary".[117] The creosote bush hologram in the film was created by projecting different "slices" of the light on Chalamet's face during plate photography based on his position on the set using a projector. Wylie then completed the scene by adding the hologram around him. For the hunter-seeker, the team used a stick on set as reference, and later replaced it with the proper models via CGI. Practical rigs were attached to Skarsgård's body to create the illusion of the Baron's levitation. Sometimes, the levitation was done practically with a seesaw rig. However, the suspensor device attached to his back was inserted using CGI.[110][118]

Music
Main article: Music of Dune (2021 film)

Hans Zimmer composed the film's score.
Hans Zimmer affirmed he would be scoring Dune near the start of the film's production in March 2019.[34] Zimmer previously worked with Villeneuve on Blade Runner 2049 (2017). At the time, Zimmer rejected director Christopher Nolan's request to compose the score for his then-upcoming film Tenet (2020), citing his personal love for the book.[119] Zimmer did not want the soundtrack to sound like his previous works and used instruments atypical of a Western orchestra.[120] He avoided watching Lynch's Dune so as not to be influenced by Toto's music, instead spending a week in a Utah desert to incorporate its sounds into the score. The music was performed using an eclectic set of instruments, including some created specifically for the soundtrack. Performers for the score include guitarist Guthrie Govan and vocalist Loire Cotler. Additional music was composed by Steve Mazzaro and David Fleming, both of whom worked in collaboration with Zimmer to keep his pieces on theme.[120] The soundtrack pieces include bagpipes for the House Atreides theme, which was suggested as Villeneuve's idea of something "ancient and organic". Zimmer found 30 bagpipe players around Edinburgh during the COVID-19 pandemic and recorded them playing in a church.[121]

For the first Dune trailer, Zimmer supervised a 32-person choir via FaceTime (necessitated by pandemic restrictions) for the recording of a cover of Pink Floyd's song "Eclipse". Choir members gathered in groups of four over eight separate sessions in Santa Monica at Zimmer's Remote Control studio while Zimmer conducted from home.[122]

Three soundtrack albums were released for the film by WaterTower Music, including The Dune Sketchbook (Music from the Soundtrack), Dune (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), and The Art and Soul of Dune on September 3, September 17, and October 22, 2021, respectively. Villeneuve said Zimmer spent "months and months creating new instruments, defining, creating, and seeking new sounds, pushing the envelope" and praised his work on the film. Two singles were released on July 22, titled "Paul's Dream" and "Ripples in the Sand".[123] The film's score was nominated for the Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 2022 Grammy Awards.[124]

Marketing
Vanity Fair published a two-part extensive first-look report on Dune by April 14, 2020.[37] Empire's October 2020 issue's cover story included an in-depth look at the film and interviews with cast and crew, providing additional first looks ahead of the film's trailer release.[125] A teaser trailer was released on September 9, 2020, featuring a remix of the Pink Floyd song "Eclipse" (1973) combined with Zimmer's score.[126][127] Zack Sharf of IndieWire gave the trailer a positive review, and wrote "It's full of eye-popping set design", in addition to stating, "The two [Denis Villeneuve and Greig Fraser] have brought a tangibility to Frank Herbert's world that should make Dune a visceral experience for moviegoers."[128] Miles Surrey from The Ringer also gave the trailer a positive review, and felt the trailer "undoubtedly looks promising," and noted that, though the source material has been "notoriously unadaptable," he felt "the curse could be broken," due to the cast and Villeneuve's direction.[129] Similarly, Deadline Hollywood's Dino-Ray Ramos also praised the trailer for its scale, writing that it contained "sci-fi prestige and the epic scale that includes mind-boggling action, elegant cinematography and fantastical nuances that still leave room for grounded and very human storytelling".[127]

The first ten minutes of the film were screened in select IMAX theaters worldwide on July 21 and 22, 2021, in an event that also included a behind-the-scenes look at the film and the debut of the film's theatrical trailer, on July 22.[130][131] Angela Wattercutter of Wired stated that the trailer "is begging you to see it in theaters".[132] Jennifer Yuma from Variety praised the cast and visuals, and praised its scope, calling the trailer "epic".[133] Similarly, Aaron Couch from The Hollywood Reporter also praised the cast and thought the film was an "ambitious sci-fi adaptation".[134] Anthony Breznican from Vanity Fair also gave the trailer a positive review and stated, "It will seem more mysterious to those unfamiliar with the story, but like Chani does herself in those dream missives to Paul, it hints at big, impressive things to come."[135] Vulture's Zoe Haylock was also impressed by the trailer, and advocated watching the film in theaters, praising the visuals as "transcendental natural settings".[136] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christian Holub felt the trailer "sets the stage cleanly".[137]

On February 26, 2019, Funcom entered into an exclusive partnership with Legendary Entertainment to develop games related to the upcoming Dune films.[138] An artbook, The Art and Soul of Dune, was released alongside the film on October 22, 2021. The book was written by the executive producer Tanya Lapointe, and it included a soundtrack album of the same name composed by Zimmer. The book was available in both a standard and deluxe edition.[139] In September 2020, McFarlane Toys started a line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the film.[140] A 12-inch figure of Baron Harkonnen was introduced at the same time.[140] The action figures were released in December 2020.[141]Legendary Comics announced Dune: The Official Movie Graphic Novel via Kickstarter and published the comic in December 2022 by writer Lilah Sturges and art by Drew Johnson.[142]

Release
Theatrical and streaming
Dune was originally scheduled to be released on November 20, 2020, but was pushed back to December 18, 2020.[143][33][144] The film was then delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this time to October 1, 2021, taking over the release date slot of The Batman, where it was theatrically released in 3D.[145] In late June 2021, Warner Bros. delayed the film's American release date again by three weeks to October 22, 2021, to avoid competition with No Time to Die.[146] Over a month before the domestic North American release date, the film had a staggered theatrical release schedule in most international markets that do not have HBO Max, beginning on September 15, including France, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland.[147][148][149] A week ahead of the United States release, Warner Bros. announced that the film's availability on HBO Max would start on the evening of October 21, 2021, correlating with typical early Thursday theatrical showings for films released on Fridays (although the studio had not been doing early Thursday previews for most of the rest of their hybrid theatrical/HBO Max releases. The other exception being The Suicide Squad, which had the same strategy for its early Thursday previews/HBO Max release).[150]

Like all 2021 Warner Bros. films, Dune was streamed simultaneously on HBO Max for a period of one month.[151] The film was then removed from the service and followed the normal home media release schedule,[151][152] similar to the process Warner Bros. used for Wonder Woman 1984 (2020).[153] Many production companies and directors expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, including Villeneuve and Legendary Pictures.[154] In a column published in Variety, Villeneuve expressed concerns about the film's financial success and piracy.[155]

Dune had its world premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2021.[156][157] It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival with an IMAX premiere screening at the Ontario Place Cinesphere on September 11, 2021.[158][159] Jason Momoa tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the film's London premiere on October 15, 2021.[160][161] On October 17, the film was leaked online ahead of its planned US and HBO Max release.[162] The film returned for a theatrical run at IMAX theaters from December 3, 2021.[163] From January 24, 2024, screenings included an exclusive preview of Dune: Part Two ahead of its March 2024 release.[164]

Home media
The film was released digitally on December 3, 2021, while Blu-ray, DVD and Ultra HD Blu-ray versions of the film were released on January 11, 2022, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[165] After its release on home media, Dune ranked first on the "NPD VideoScan First Alert" chart for combined Blu-ray and DVD sales as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart.[166] According to The Numbers, it sold a combined 215,375 Blu-ray and DVD units in the first week for $3.6 million.[3] It retained the top position on both the charts of the NPD Group for the following two weeks before being displaced by Ghostbusters: Afterlife.[167][168] In addition, it was the most rented title from Redbox kiosks for three weeks as well.[169][170] It was the highest-selling movie for the month of January according to the "NPD VideoScan First Alert" chart.[171]

Reception
Box office
Dune grossed $110 million in the United States and Canada, and $324.8 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $434.8 million.[3] Deadline Hollywood reported that a total box office gross of $300 million, the combined cost of production and marketing, "will make many happy from an image-standpoint, even if breakeven is far north of that".[172]

In the US and Canada, the film made $41 million in its opening weekend from 4,125 theaters,[173] surpassing its projected opening weekend estimates of $30–35 million and besting the debut of Godzilla vs. Kong ($31.6 million) for the highest opening weekend for Warner Bros. during the pandemic era.[172][174] Of that opening weekend take, $17.5 million came from its first day ticket sales, including $5.1 million from Thursday night previews. Dune also had the best opening of Villeneuve's career.[173] The film fell 62% in its second weekend to $15.5 million, though it remained atop the domestic box office.[175][176] In its third weekend it dropped by 51% to earn $7.6 million, and was displaced by Eternals from the top rank.[177] On November 25, 2021, Dune became the second Warner Bros. film of the pandemic era to cross $100 million in the US and Canada, following Godzilla vs. Kong.[178]

The film was released in 14 markets outside the US and Canada on September 15, 2021. It grossed $37.9 million, with the largest markets being Russia and CIS ($8.9 million),[179] France ($7.2 million), Germany ($4.4 million), Taiwan ($3.4 million), Italy ($2.5 million) and Spain ($2.4 million).[180] After adding an additional $26.3 million from 32 countries in its second weekend, the film had a 10-day running total of $76.5 million.[181]

In China, Dune opened to a $21.6 million weekend according to estimates by Warner Brothers, ranking second on the country's box office behind The Battle at Lake Changjin.[182] In its fourth week of release outside the US and Canada, the film made $21.4 million in 75 countries, a drop of 54% from the previous weekend.[183] It also fell by 78% to about $5 million in China, dropping to the third rank.[184][185] The film crossed the $300 million global mark on November 2.[186] During the fifth weekend it earned $11.1 million, a drop of 52%.[187] This included $2.1 million in China where it dropped to the fifth rank.[188]

After its return to IMAX for a week on December 2, the film earned an estimated $1.8 million during the weekend, a drop of 13% from the previous weekend, primarily due to earning around $1 million from IMAX. In Australia it debuted atop the box office chart, earning $3.4 million in the opening weekend.[189] The $400 million global mark was crossed on February 14, 2022, with the largest running-total countries outside the US and Canada being China ($39.5 million), France ($32.6 million), the UK ($30 million), Germany ($22.5 million) and Russia ($21.3 million).[190]

Streaming viewership
According to Samba TV, the film was watched in over 1.9 million US households during its first three days of release,[191] which grew to 2.3 million within its first week of release.[192] 3.9 million US households had watched the film within its first 30 days of release.[193] According to TV Time, it was the most-watched film overall in the United States from the first to the third week of its release consecutively,[194] before dropping to the sixth rank in its fourth week.[195] The film rose to the third rank on TV Time's chart in the final week of its availability.[196][152] It was the ninth-most-streamed-film of 2021 according to the service.[197] By March 20, the film had been streamed in 5.3 million households in the US, including 996,000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8.[198]

After its release on PVOD services, Dune debuted at the second position on iTunes and Vudu charts, while being ranked seventh on Google Play.[199] The following week it fell to the seventh position on iTunes and the third position on Vudu, while maintaining its ranking on Google Play.[200] After falling out of the charts for two weeks, it found renewed interest as it rose to the tenth position on iTunes, seventh position on Google Play, and the fifth position on Vudu.[201] It however fell out of the iTunes and Google Play charts again in the following week, while dropping to the tenth position on the Vudu chart.[202]

The film was the highest-selling title on Redbox's digital service for the week of January 24–30, 2022.[169] It was also the top-ranked film on iTunes during the same week.[203] Following the Academy Awards nominations, it reentered the top 10 charts for iTunes, Google Play and Vudu.[204]

Critical response
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of 513 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation."[205] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 68 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[206] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 84% positive score (with an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars) and 66% saying they would definitely recommend it.[173] Following its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in September 2021, early reception was generally positive, receiving praise for its ambition, story, scope, worldbuilding, performances (particularly those of Chalamet and Ferguson) and production values, although some critics considered the story to be incomplete and dull. Its writing and scope continued to be praised following its release, while others criticized the runtime, pacing, and adaptation of the source material.[207][208][209]

Ben Travis of Empire, Robbie Collin from The Daily Telegraph, and Xan Brooks at The Guardian rated the film five out of five stars.[210][211][212] Travis praised the writing and direction, feeling it helped properly establish elements of worldbuilding. He also lauded Fraser's cinematography and Zimmer's score, calling the film "blockbuster filmmaking in the Christopher Nolan mould", and praising Chalamet and Ferguson's performances. However, he felt that the "emotional strings" did not work as well.[210] Brooks agreed with the sentiment that it was a high-quality blockbuster film and found it "the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse", citing the worldbuilding, ensemble cast, and set pieces as positive elements.[212] Collins also praised the writing and Chalamet and Ferguson's performances, feeling the exposition was written well. However, he highlighted the production design and the sandworms, calling the latter "threateningly alien, but also enticing, even addictive" and commenting "the sets ring with the desolate grandeur of ancient ruins".[211]

In a positive yet more critical review, Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times felt the film used thematic elements from the novel well, and also lauded the production values albeit labelling the visual aesthetic as monochromatic. Chang further went on to praise the plot for increasing the role of women in the story and tension regarding anticipation of action sequences, which he thought were directed well. However, he disliked the "abrupt, unsatisfying" ending and wanted Villeneuve's style to align with David Lynch's style, which he considered to contain "feverish, pustular imagery".[213] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who graded the film a B, wrote that Dune had little exposition and also appreciated the worldbuilding and visual aesthetic. However, she did not appreciate the jokes and felt the script gradually adjusted "and soon settles into a kind of grim grandeur", highlighting Chalamet and Isaac's performances.[214] The New York Times's Manohla Dargis also admired the production values and worldbuilding, adding the exposition and pacing was appropriate to establish the latter. However, while she felt Villeneuve had attempted to be faithful to the source material, she also opined that Villeneuve was trying to satisfy the demands of the contemporary film industry. Her major issues were also with the ending and what she deemed to be a "white man leading a fateful charge", though she refrained from labelling it a white savior narrative.[215]

Critic Owen Gleiberman's review in Variety was more negative: he appreciated the film's extensive focus on worldbuilding, but felt it had also undermined the storytelling. He found the title of "Dune Part I [sic]" to be "presumptuous", regarding it to be analogous to how other film franchises advertise future installments. Gleiberman felt the film's spectacles, including the sandworm and ornithopter sequences, disengage him from the story, saying "as the movie begins to run out of tricks, it turns woozy and amorphous".[216] Reviewing the film for TheWrap, Steve Pond noted the film's darker tone had remained consistent, and cited the production design and scope as positive elements. Pond enjoyed the action sequences on Arrakis and appreciated that Villeneuve "finds some dark poetry in the way he plays up the story’s mystical elements". However, he was mixed on the film's dark tone, regarding it as a tonal deviation from his previous films but also allowing it to be "giant mood piece that can be exhilarating in its dark beauty".[217] Roxana Hadadi's review in Vulture critiqued the way the film flattened the cultural and religious complexities of the book and opted for a more generic portrayal of people of color without specific representation from Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) actors.[46]

Other commentators and academics also perceived the film to have neglected and appropriated Arabian and Islamic elements which influenced Dune, and to have excluded Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) actors. Serena Rasoul, founder of Muslim Casting, wanted more MENA representation and labelled the lack of MENA actors an "erasure". However, she also acknowledged the cast's overall diversity and did not call the film Orientalist.[218] On the other hand, Ph.D. student in History at Princeton University Haris Durrari deemed it to be Orientalist as he opined it reduced Arab influences to "exotic aesthetics" and "broad abstractions".[219] Meanwhile, Ali Karjoo-Ravary, an Assistant Professor of Islamic Studies at Bucknell University, felt that the casting of African actors excluded MENA actors, and that characters portrayed by African people felt "ultimately empty" as they had died or were not as developed as Paul and Lady Jessica.[220]

Accolades
Main article: List of accolades received by Dune (2021 film)
Dune was nominated for ten Academy Awards (winning six),[221] three Golden Globe Awards (winning one),[222] eleven British Academy Film Awards (winning five),[223] ten Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning three),[224] two AACTA International Awards (winning one),[225] ten Satellite Awards (winning five),[226] one Grammy Award,[227] one Hollywood Music in Media Awards (won),[228] four People's Choice Awards,[229] one Screen Actors Guild Awards,[230] three Dorian Awards (winning one),[231] and one Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award (won),[232] among others. It was also ranked as one of the top ten films of 2021 by the American Film Institute.[233]

Analysis
In Adaptations of Dune, Kara Kennedy explores the film's production history and how faithful the film is to the source material, concluding that some parts are very faithful while others are heavily adjusted, such as the opening of the story and the portrayal of the Harkonnen.[234] In The Orientalist Semiotics of Dune, Frank Jacob finds that the film has a stronger Orientalization of the Fremen than Lynch's film adaptation, shown through elements such as Chani appearing like the Afghan Girl on the cover of National Geographic in 1985.[235] In two chapters in Dune and Philosophy, Ed­wardo Pérez explores the depiction of the Fremen, masculinity and femininity, and issues of cultural appropriation in the film.[236][237]

Several articles in the journal Ekphrasis: Images, Cinema, Theory, Media critically examine the film in terms of narrative and transformation from the source material. Yosr Dridi finds that the casting and screenplay changes made to modernize the source material give the story an Orientalist window dressing but hide a lack of substance underneath.[238] Misha Grifka Wander shows how the film downplays ecology and elements from MENA cultures in favor of the chosen one storytelling trope.[239] Doru Pop discusses the controversies and changes made in the adaptation of Dune to film and Isaac Asimov's Foundation to a television series, particularly the gender and racial changes to key characters.[240] Ion Indolean looks at how Villeneuve cinematographically expresses the story of Paul using elements of the space opera genre and follows in the steps of director Ridley Scott in Blade Runner (1982) and Alien (1979).[241]

Sequels and spin-offs
Villeneuve intended to make a two-part adaptation of the novel, and by November 2019, Jon Spaihts left his position as showrunner on Dune: Prophecy to focus on writing the sequel film.[36][242] Villeneuve felt that Warner Bros.' decision in December 2020 to simultaneously release their 2021 films through HBO Max alongside a theatrical release due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema could compromise the film's financial performance, resulting in the cancellation of the sequel, though Warner Bros. assured him a sequel would be greenlit as long as the film performed well on HBO Max.[155]

Following the film's success, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures officially greenlit Dune: Part Two in October 2021.[243][244] Villeneuve's main concern was to finish the production, which would benefit from all the work on the first part.[243] Main characters reprise their role from the first film, with additional casting lasting from March to July 2022, and concluding by January 2023.[245] Preliminary filming began in Italy by early July 2022, and concluded that December.[246][247] The film was released on March 1, 2024.[248] Dune: Part Two's world premiere took place at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on February 15.[249][250]

Villeneuve expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah, the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended on the success of Dune: Part Two.[251][252] Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off series Dune: Prophecy.[253] In August 2023, Villeneuve declared his intentions for the film to serve as the conclusion of his Dune trilogy.[254] Villeneuve began developing a script by 2023.[255] In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was "almost finished" but also wanted to take time to ensure his satisfaction, citing Hollywood's tendency of focusing on release dates over quality.[256] Ahead of Dune: Part Two's release, Hans Zimmer revealed he was already writing music for a third film.[257]

In June 2019, Legendary Television announced it is producing a spin-off series, Dune: The Sisterhood, for WarnerMedia's streaming service, HBO Max. The series serves as a prequel to the film and centers on the Bene Gesserit. Initially, Villeneuve was going to direct the series' pilot, with Spaihts writing the screenplay and Dana Calvo as showrunner for the series.[258][259] In November 2019, Spaihts left the series as writer to focus on the sequel film.[242] Spaihts and Villeneuve remain as executive producers along with Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, and Kim Herbert.[260] In July 2021, Diane Ademu-John took over as showrunner.[261] Spaihts and Villeneuve confirmed in March 2022 that the show is still in development.[253] In April 2022, it was announced that Johan Renck will direct the first two episodes.[262] Travis Fimmel joined the cast in November 2022.[263] In February 2023, it was announced that production was put on hiatus as Renck exited the project.[264] The series was retitled Dune: Prophecy in November 2023.[265]

J. Robert Oppenheimer (born Julius Robert Oppenheimer; /ˈɒpənhaɪmər/ OP-ən-hy-mər; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist. He was director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II and is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".

Born in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925 and a doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927, where he studied under Max Born. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and early work on quantum tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.

In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, and in 1943 he was appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons. His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.

In 1947, Oppenheimer became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. He lobbied for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a 1949–1950 governmental debate on the question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government and military factions. During the second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's stances, together with his past associations with the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance, following a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and his career as a nuclear physicist. Also stripped of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer nevertheless continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. In 1963, as a gesture of political rehabilitation, he was given the Enrico Fermi Award. He died four years later, of throat cancer. In 2022, the federal government vacated the 1954 revocation of his security clearance.

Early life
Childhood and education
Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer[note 1] into a non-observant Jewish family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful textile importer.[5][6] Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist.[7] Their father was born in Hanau, when it was still part of the Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and as a teenager made his way to the United States in 1888, without money, higher education, or even English. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy.[8] In 1912, the family moved to an apartment on Riverside Drive near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses.[6] Their art collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and Vincent van Gogh.[9]

Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School. In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society School,[10] founded by Felix Adler to promote training based on the Ethical Culture movement, whose motto was "Deed before Creed". Oppenheimer's father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its board of trustees.[11] Oppenheimer was a versatile student, interested in English and French literature, and particularly mineralogy.[12] He completed third and fourth grades in one year and skipped half of eighth grade.[10] During his final year, Oppenheimer became interested in chemistry.[13] He graduated in 1921, but his further education was delayed a year by an attack of colitis contracted while prospecting in Joachimstal during a family vacation in Czechoslovakia. He recovered in New Mexico, where he developed a love for horseback riding and the southwestern United States.[14]

Oppenheimer entered Harvard College in 1922 at age 18. He majored in chemistry; Harvard also required studies in history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. To compensate for the delay caused by his illness, he took six courses each term instead of the usual four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he could bypass basic courses in favor of advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics taught by Percy Bridgman. Oppenheimer graduated from Harvard in 1925 with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only three years of study.[15]

After being accepted at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1924, Oppenheimer wrote to Ernest Rutherford requesting permission to work at the Cavendish Laboratory, though Bridgman's letter of recommendation said that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory suggested that theoretical, rather than experimental, physics would be his forte. Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge nonetheless;[16] J. J. Thomson ultimately accepted him on the condition that he complete a basic laboratory course.[17]

Oppenheimer was very unhappy at Cambridge and wrote to a friend: "I am having a pretty bad time. The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything."[18] He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, Patrick Blackett, a future Nobel laureate. According to Oppenheimer's friend Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once confessed to leaving a poisoned apple on Blackett's desk, and Oppenheimer's parents convinced the university authorities not to expel him. There are no records of either a poisoning incident or probation, but Oppenheimer had regular sessions with a psychiatrist in Harley Street, London.[19][20][21][22] Oppenheimer was a tall, thin chain smoker,[23] who often neglected to eat during periods of intense concentration. Many friends said he could be self-destructive. Fergusson once tried to distract Oppenheimer from apparent depression by telling him about his girlfriend, Frances Keeley, and how he had proposed to her. Oppenheimer did not take the news well. He jumped on Fergusson and tried to strangle him. Oppenheimer was plagued by periods of depression throughout his life,[24][25] and once told his brother, "I need physics more than friends."[26]

In 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen to study under Max Born; Göttingen was one of the world's leading centers for theoretical physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was enthusiastic in discussions to the point of sometimes taking them over.[27] Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.[28]

Oppenheimer obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree in March 1927 at age 23, supervised by Born.[29][30] After the oral exam, James Franck, the professor administering it, reportedly said, "I'm glad that's over. He was on the point of questioning me."[31] Oppenheimer published more than a dozen papers while in Europe, including many important contributions to the new field of quantum mechanics. He and Born published a famous paper on the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the mathematical treatment of molecules, allowing nuclear motion to be neglected to simplify calculations. It remains his most cited work.[32]

Oppenheimer was awarded a United States National Research Council fellowship to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in September 1927. Bridgman also wanted him at Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in 1927 and Caltech in 1928.[33] At Caltech, he struck up a close friendship with Linus Pauling; they planned to mount a joint attack on the nature of the chemical bond, a field in which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results. The collaboration, and their friendship, ended after Oppenheimer invited Pauling's wife, Ava Helen Pauling, to join him on a tryst in Mexico.[34] Oppenheimer later invited Pauling to be head of the Chemistry Division of the Manhattan Project, but Pauling refused, saying he was a pacifist.[35]

In the autumn of 1928, Oppenheimer visited Paul Ehrenfest's institute at the University of Leiden, the Netherlands, where he impressed by giving lectures in Dutch, despite having little experience with the language. There, he was given the nickname of Opje,[36] later anglicized by his students as "Oppie".[37] From Leiden, he continued on to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich to work with Wolfgang Pauli on quantum mechanics and the continuous spectrum. Oppenheimer respected and liked Pauli and may have emulated his personal style as well as his critical approach to problems.[38]

On returning to the United States, Oppenheimer accepted an associate professorship from the University of California, Berkeley, where Raymond T. Birge wanted him so badly that he expressed a willingness to share him with Caltech.[35]

Before he began his Berkeley professorship, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with a mild case of tuberculosis and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at a New Mexico ranch, which he leased and eventually purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease, he exclaimed, "Hot dog!", and he later called it Perro Caliente ("hot dog" in Spanish).[39] Later, he used to say that "physics and desert country" were his "two great loves".[40] He recovered from tuberculosis and returned to Berkeley, where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator to a generation of physicists who admired him for his intellectual virtuosity and broad interests. His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other as a pretentious and insecure poseur.[41] His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages.[42] Hans Bethe said of him:

Probably the most important ingredient he brought to his teaching was his exquisite taste. He always knew what were the important problems, as shown by his choice of subjects. He truly lived with those problems, struggling for a solution, and he communicated his concern to the group. In its heyday, there were about eight or ten graduate students in his group and about six Post-doctoral Fellows. He met this group once a day in his office and discussed with one after another the status of the student's research problem. He was interested in everything, and in one afternoon they might discuss quantum electrodynamics, cosmic rays, electron pair production and nuclear physics.[43]

Oppenheimer worked closely with Nobel Prize-winning experimental physicist Ernest O. Lawrence and his cyclotron pioneers, helping them understand the data that their machines were producing at Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory, which eventually developed into today's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.[44] In 1936, Berkeley promoted him to full professor at an annual salary of $3,300 (equivalent to $70,000 in 2022). In return, he was asked to curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.[45]

Oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to get Robert Serber a position at Berkeley but was blocked by Birge, who felt that "one Jew in the department was enough".[46]

Scientific work
Oppenheimer did important research in theoretical astronomy (especially as related to general relativity and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field theory, including its extension into quantum electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, including the neutron, meson and neutron star.[47]

Initially, his major interest was the theory of the continuous spectrum. His first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the Sun, but not helium. Years later, it was realized that the Sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were correct.[48][49]

Oppenheimer made important contributions to the theory of cosmic ray showers. He also worked on the problem of field electron emission.[50][51] This work contributed to the development of the concept of quantum tunneling.[52] In 1931, he co-wrote a paper, "Relativistic Theory of the Photoelectric Effect," with his student Harvey Hall,[53] in which, based on empirical evidence, he correctly disputed Paul Dirac's assertion that two of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom have the same energy. Subsequently, one of his doctoral students, Willis Lamb, determined that this was a consequence of what became known as the Lamb shift, for which Lamb was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1955.[47]

With Melba Phillips, the first graduate student to begin her PhD under Oppenheimer's supervision,[note 2] Oppenheimer worked on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons. When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the predictions. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory—subsequently known as the Oppenheimer–Phillips process—to explain the results. This theory is still in use today.[55][note 3]

As early as 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper that essentially predicted the existence of the positron. This was after a paper by Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, later known as the Dirac equation, that unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect.[57] Drawing on the body of experimental evidence, Oppenheimer rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued that they would have to have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.[58]

In the late 1930s, Oppenheimer became interested in astrophysics, most likely through his friendship with Richard Tolman, resulting in a series of papers. In the first of these, "On the Stability of Stellar Neutron Cores" (1938),[59] co-written with Serber, Oppenheimer explored the properties of white dwarfs. This was followed by a paper co-written with one of his students, George Volkoff, "On Massive Neutron Cores,"[60] which demonstrated that there was a limit, known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, to the mass of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as neutron stars and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, Oppenheimer and another of his students, Hartland Snyder, produced the paper "On Continued Gravitational Contraction",[61] which predicted the existence of what later became termed black holes. After the Born–Oppenheimer approximation paper, these papers remain his most cited, and were key factors in the rejuvenation of astrophysical research in the United States in the 1950s, mainly by John A. Wheeler.[62]

Oppenheimer's papers were considered difficult to understand even by the standards of the abstract topics he was expert in. He was fond of using elegant, if extremely complex, mathematical techniques to demonstrate physical principles, though he was sometimes criticized for making mathematical mistakes, presumably out of haste. "His physics was good", said his student Snyder, "but his arithmetic awful."[47]

After World War II, Oppenheimer published only five scientific papers, one of them in biophysics, and none after 1950. Murray Gell-Mann, a later Nobelist who, as a visiting scientist, worked with him at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1951, offered this opinion:

He didn't have Sitzfleisch, "sitting flesh," when you sit on a chair. As far as I know, he never wrote a long paper or did a long calculation, anything of that kind. He didn't have patience for that; his own work consisted of little aperçus, but quite brilliant ones. But he inspired other people to do things, and his influence was fantastic.[63]

Private and political life

Oppenheimer's mother died in 1931, and he became closer to his father who, although still living in New York, became a frequent visitor in California.[64] When his father died in 1937, leaving $392,602 (equivalent to $8 million in 2022) to be divided between Oppenheimer and his brother Frank, Oppenheimer immediately wrote out a will that left his estate to the University of California to be used for graduate scholarships.[65]

Politics
During the 1920s, Oppenheimer remained uninformed on world affairs. He claimed that he did not read newspapers or popular magazines and only learned of the Wall Street crash of 1929 while he was on a walk with Ernest Lawrence six months after the crash occurred.[66][67] He once remarked that he never cast a vote until the 1936 presidential election. From 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs. In 1934, he earmarked three percent of his annual salary—about $100 (equivalent to $2,200 in 2022)—for two years to support German physicists fleeing Nazi Germany.[68] During the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike, he and some of his students, including Melba Phillips and Serber, attended a longshoremen's rally.[46]

After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Oppenheimer hosted fundraisers for the Spanish Republican cause. In 1939, he joined the American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom, which campaigned against the persecution of Jewish scientists in Nazi Germany. Like most liberal groups of the era, the committee was later branded a communist front.[68]

Many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active in the Communist Party in the 1930s or 1940s, including his brother Frank, Frank's wife Jackie,[69] Kitty,[70] Jean Tatlock, his landlady Mary Ellen Washburn,[71] and several of his graduate students at Berkeley.[72] Whether Oppenheimer was a party member has been debated. Cassidy states that he never openly joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA),[68] but Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev state that he "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s".[73] From 1937 to 1942, Oppenheimer was a member at Berkeley of what he called a "discussion group", which fellow members Haakon Chevalier[74][75] and Gordon Griffiths later said was a "closed" (secret) unit of the Communist Party for Berkeley faculty.[76]

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941. It recorded that he attended a meeting in December 1940 at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary, William Schneiderman, and its treasurer, Isaac Folkoff. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the executive committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a communist front organization. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency.[77]

When he joined the Manhattan Project in 1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he had been "a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the West Coast."[78] Years later, he claimed that he did not remember writing this, that it was not true, and that if he had written anything along those lines, it was "a half-jocular overstatement".[79] He was a subscriber to the People's World,[80] a Communist Party organ, and testified in 1954, "I was associated with the communist movement."[81]

In 1953, Oppenheimer was on the sponsoring committee for a conference on "Science and Freedom" organized by the Congress for Cultural Freedom, an anti-communist cultural organization.[82]

At his 1954 security clearance hearings, Oppenheimer denied being a member of the Communist Party but identified himself as a fellow traveler, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of communism's goals but is not willing to blindly follow orders from any Communist Party apparatus.[83] According to biographer Ray Monk: "He was, in a very practical and real sense, a supporter of the Communist Party. Moreover, in terms of the time, effort and money spent on party activities, he was a very committed supporter."[84]

Relationships and children
In 1936, Oppenheimer became involved with Jean Tatlock, the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at Stanford University School of Medicine. The two had similar political views; she wrote for the Western Worker, a Communist Party newspaper.[85] In 1939, after a tempestuous relationship, Tatlock broke up with Oppenheimer. In August of that year, he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Kitty's first marriage had lasted only a few months. Her second, common-law, husband from 1934 to 1937 was Joe Dallet, an active member of the Communist Party killed in 1937 in the Spanish Civil War.[86]

Kitty returned from Europe to the U.S., where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1938 she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, and in June 1939 moved with him to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. She and Oppenheimer created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties, and in the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. When she became pregnant, Kitty asked Harrison for a divorce and he agreed to it. On November 1, 1940, she obtained a quick divorce in Reno, Nevada, and married Oppenheimer.[87][88]

Their first child, Peter, was born in May 1941, and their second, Katherine ("Toni"), was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on December 7, 1944.[89] During his marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his affair with Tatlock.[90] Later, their continued contact became an issue in his security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's communist associations.[91]

Throughout the development of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer was under investigation by both the FBI and the Manhattan Project's internal security arm for his past left-wing associations. He was followed by Army security agents during a trip to California in June 1943 to visit Tatlock, who was suffering from depression. Oppenheimer spent the night in her apartment.[92] Tatlock killed herself on January 4, 1944, leaving Oppenheimer deeply grieved.[93]

At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer began an emotional affair with Ruth Tolman, a psychologist and the wife of his friend Richard Tolman. The affair ended after Oppenheimer returned east to become director of the Institute for Advanced Study but, after Richard's death in August 1948, they reconnected and saw each other occasionally until Ruth's death in 1957. Few of their letters survive, but those that do reflect a close and affectionate relationship, with Oppenheimer calling her "My Love".[94][95]

Mysticism
Oppenheimer worked very hard [in the spring of 1929] but had a gift of concealing his assiduous application with an air of easy nonchalance. Actually, he was engaged in a very difficult calculation of the opacity of surfaces of stars to their internal radiation, an important constant in the theoretical construction of stellar models. He spoke little of these problems and seemed to be much more interested in literature, especially the Hindu classics and the more esoteric Western writers. Pauli once remarked to me that Oppenheimer seemed to treat physics as an avocation and psychoanalysis as a vocation.

— Isidor Isaac Rabi[96]

Oppenheimer's diverse interests sometimes interrupted his focus on science. He liked things that were difficult and since much of the scientific work appeared easy for him, he developed an interest in the mystical and the cryptic.[97] After leaving Harvard, he began to acquaint himself with the classical Hindu texts through their English translations.[98] He also had an interest in learning languages and learned Sanskrit,[note 4] under Arthur W. Ryder at Berkeley in 1933.[100][101] He eventually read literary works such as the Bhagavad Gita and Meghaduta in the original Sanskrit, and deeply pondered them. He later cited the Gita as one of the books that most shaped his philosophy of life.[102][103] He wrote to his brother that the Gita was "very easy and quite marvelous", and called it "the most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue". He later gave copies of it as presents to his friends and kept a personal, worn-out copy on the bookshelf by his desk.[101] He nicknamed his car Garuda, the mount bird of the Hindu god Vishnu.[104]

Oppenheimer never became a Hindu in the traditional sense; he did not join any temple nor pray to any god.[105][106] He "was really taken by the charm and the general wisdom of the Bhagavad-Gita," his brother said.[105] It is speculated that Oppenheimer's interest in Hindu thought started during his earlier association with Niels Bohr. Both Bohr and Oppenheimer had been very analytical and critical about the ancient Hindu mythological stories and the metaphysics embedded in them. In one conversation with David Hawkins before the war, while talking about the literature of ancient Greece, Oppenheimer remarked, "I have read the Greeks; I find the Hindus deeper."[107] During the 1930s, while teaching at Berkeley, Oppenheimer became part of a group in the Bay Area that psychologist Siegfried Bernfeld convened to discuss psychoanalysis.[108]

His close confidant and colleague Isidor Isaac Rabi, who had seen Oppenheimer throughout his Berkeley, Los Alamos, and Princeton years, wondering "why men of Oppenheimer's gifts do not discover everything worth discovering",[109] reflected that:

Oppenheimer was overeducated in those fields which lie outside the scientific tradition, such as his interest in religion, in the Hindu religion in particular, which resulted in a feeling for the mystery of the universe that surrounded him almost like a fog. He saw physics clearly, looking toward what had already been done, but at the border he tended to feel there was much more of the mysterious and novel than there actually was ... [he turned] away from the hard, crude methods of theoretical physics into a mystical realm of broad intuition.... In Oppenheimer the element of earthiness was feeble. Yet it was essentially this spiritual quality, this refinement as expressed in speech and manner, that was the basis of his charisma. He never expressed himself completely. He always left a feeling that there were depths of sensibility and insight not yet revealed. These may be the qualities of the born leader who seems to have reserves of uncommitted strength.[110]

In spite of this, observers such as physicists Luis Alvarez and Jeremy Bernstein have suggested that if Oppenheimer had lived long enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, he might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on gravitational collapse, concerning neutron stars and black holes.[111][112][113] In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his lifetime.[114] The physicist and historian Abraham Pais once asked Oppenheimer what he considered his most important scientific contributions—Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction.[115] Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1946, 1951 and 1967, but never won.[116][117]

Manhattan Project
Los Alamos
Main article: Los Alamos Laboratory
On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a crash program to develop an atomic bomb. Ernest Lawrence brought Oppenheimer into the Manhattan Project on October 21. Oppenheimer was assigned to take over the project's specific bomb-design research by Arthur Compton at the Metallurgical Laboratory.[118] On May 18, 1942,[119] National Defense Research Committee Chairman James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on fast neutron calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"; "rapid rupture" is a technical term that refers to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for atomic bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Serber, Emil Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb.[120][121]

In June 1942, the U.S. Army established the Manhattan Engineer District to handle its part in the atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the Office of Scientific Research and Development to the military.[122] In September, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project.[123] By October 12, 1942, Groves and Oppenheimer had decided that for security and cohesion, they needed to establish a centralized, secret research laboratory in a remote location.[124]

Groves selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons laboratory, although it is not known precisely when.[125] This decision surprised many, because Oppenheimer had left-wing political views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves worried that because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists,[126] but Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, and engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an "overweening ambition",[127] which Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion.[127] Oppenheimer's past associations were not overlooked, but on July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security clearance "without delay irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr Oppenheimer. He is absolutely essential to the project."[128] Rabi considered Oppenheimer's appointment "a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius".[129]

Oppenheimer favored a location for the laboratory in New Mexico, not far from his ranch. On November 16, 1942, he, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he knew well: a flat mesa near Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was the site of a private boys' school, the Los Alamos Ranch School. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply but otherwise felt that it was ideal.[130] The Los Alamos Laboratory was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings were erected in great haste. At the laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top physicists of the time, whom he called the "luminaries".[131]

Los Alamos was initially supposed to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at 128 pounds (58 kg), diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis, and were concerned about his chronic lumbosacral joint pain.[132] The plan to commission scientists fell through when Rabi and Robert Bacher balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the University of California operated the laboratory under contract to the War Department.[133] It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project: Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.[132]

Oppenheimer at first had difficulty with the organizational division of large groups but rapidly learned the art of large-scale administration after he took up permanent residence at Los Alamos. He was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and the military. Victor Weisskopf wrote:

Oppenheimer directed these studies, theoretical and experimental, in the real sense of the words. Here his uncanny speed in grasping the main points of any subject was a decisive factor; he could acquaint himself with the essential details of every part of the work.

He did not direct from the head office. He was intellectually and physically present at each decisive step. He was present in the laboratory or in the seminar rooms, when a new effect was measured, when a new idea was conceived. It was not that he contributed so many ideas or suggestions; he did so sometimes, but his main influence came from something else. It was his continuous and intense presence, which produced a sense of direct participation in all of us; it created that unique atmosphere of enthusiasm and challenge that pervaded the place throughout its time.[134]

At this point in the war, there was considerable anxiety among the scientists that the German nuclear weapons program might be progressing faster than the Manhattan Project.[135][136] In a letter dated May 25, 1943, Oppenheimer responded to a proposal by Fermi to use radioactive materials to poison German food supplies. Oppenheimer asked Fermi whether he could produce enough strontium without letting too many in on the secret. Oppenheimer continued, "I think we should not attempt a plan unless we can poison food sufficient to kill a half a million men."[137]

In 1943, development efforts were directed to a plutonium gun-type fission weapon called "Thin Man". Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure but could be created only in tiny amounts. When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor in April 1944, a problem was discovered: reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240 (five times that of "cyclotron" plutonium), making it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon.[138]

In July 1944, Oppenheimer abandoned the Thin Man gun design in favor of an implosion-type weapon; a smaller version of Thin Man became Little Boy. Using chemical explosive lenses, a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form. The metal needed to travel only very short distances, so the critical mass would be assembled in much less time.[139] In August 1944, Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.[140] He concentrated the development efforts on the gun-type device, but now with a simpler design that only had to work with highly enriched uranium, in a single group. This device became Little Boy in February 1945.[141] After a mammoth research effort, the more complex design of the implosion device, known as the "Christy gadget" after Robert Christy, another student of Oppenheimer's,[142] was finalized as Fat Man in a meeting in Oppenheimer's office on February 28, 1945.[143]

In May 1945, an Interim Committee was created to advise and report on wartime and postwar policies regarding the use of nuclear energy. The Interim Committee established a scientific panel consisting of Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton, Fermi, and Lawrence to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the panel offered its opinion not just on an atomic bomb's likely physical effects but also on its likely military and political impact.[144] This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.[145]

Trinity

The Trinity test was the first detonation of a nuclear device.[146]
In the early morning hours of July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, the work at Los Alamos culminated in the test of the world's first nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer had code-named the site "Trinity" in mid-1944, saying later that the name came from John Donne's Holy Sonnets; he had been introduced to Donne's work in the 1930s by Jean Tatlock, who killed herself in January 1944.[147][148]

Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, who was present in the control bunker with Oppenheimer, recalled:

Dr. Oppenheimer, on whom had rested a very heavy burden, grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself. For the last few seconds, he stared directly ahead and then when the announcer shouted "Now!" and there came this tremendous burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief.[149]

Oppenheimer's brother Frank recalled Oppenheimer's first words as "I guess it worked."[150][151]

According to a 1949 magazine profile, while witnessing the explosion Oppenheimer thought of verses from the Bhagavad Gita: "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one ... Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds."[153] In 1965 he recalled the moment this way:

We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.[154][note 5]

Rabi described seeing Oppenheimer somewhat later: "I'll never forget his walk ... like High Noon ... this kind of strut. He had done it."[161] Despite many scientists' opposition to using the bomb on Japan, Compton, Fermi, and Oppenheimer believed that a test explosion would not convince Japan to surrender.[162] At an August 6 assembly at Los Alamos, the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together "like a prize-winning boxer" while the crowd cheered. He expressed regret that the weapon was ready too late for use against Nazi Germany.[163]

On August 17, however, Oppenheimer traveled to Washington to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned.[164] In October he met with President Harry S. Truman, who dismissed Oppenheimer's concern about an arms race with the Soviet Union and belief that atomic energy should be under international control. Truman became infuriated when Oppenheimer said, "Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands", responding that he (Truman) bore sole responsibility for the decision to use atomic weapons against Japan, and later said, "I don't want to see that son of a bitch in this office ever again."[165][166]

For his services as director of Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was awarded the Medal for Merit by Truman in 1946.[167]

Postwar activities
Once the public learned of the Manhattan Project after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer—suddenly a household name as the "father of the atomic bomb"—became a national spokesman for science, emblematic of a new type of technocratic power;[93][168][169] he appeared on the covers of Life and Time.[170][171] Nuclear physics became a powerful force as nations realized the strategic and political power that atomic weapons conferred. Like many scientists of his generation, Oppenheimer felt that security from atomic bombs could come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.[172]

Institute for Advanced Study

In November 1945, Oppenheimer left Los Alamos to return to Caltech,[173] but soon found that his heart was no longer in teaching.[174] In 1947, he accepted an offer from Lewis Strauss to take up the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. This meant moving back east and leaving Ruth Tolman, the wife of his friend Richard Tolman, with whom he had begun an affair after leaving Los Alamos.[175] The job came with a salary of $20,000 per annum, plus rent-free accommodation in the director's house, a 17th-century manor with a cook and groundskeeper, surrounded by 265 acres (107 ha) of woodlands.[176] He collected European furniture, and French post-impressionist and Fauvist artworks. His art collection included works by Cézanne, Derain, Despiau, de Vlaminck, Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, Van Gogh and Vuillard.[177]

Oppenheimer brought together intellectuals at the height of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.[178]

During a series of conferences in New York from 1947 through 1949, physicists transitioned from war work back to theoretical issues. Under Oppenheimer's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problem of the pre-war years: infinite, divergent, and seemingly nonsensical expressions in the quantum electrodynamics of elementary particles. Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Shin'ichiro Tomonaga tackled the problem of regularization, and developed techniques that became known as renormalization. Freeman Dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of meson absorption and Hideki Yukawa's theory of mesons as the carrier particles of the strong nuclear force were also tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted Robert Marshak's innovative two-meson hypothesis: that there are actually two types of mesons, pions and muons. This led to Cecil Frank Powell's breakthrough and subsequent Nobel Prize for the discovery of the pion.[179][note 6]

Oppenheimer served as director of the institute until 1966, when he gave up the position due to his failing health.[181] As of 2023, he is the longest-serving director of the institute.[182]

Atomic Energy Commission

The GAC in 1947; Oppenheimer is second from the left.
As a member of the Board of Consultants to a committee appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the 1946 Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. It was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union,[183] which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.[184]

After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position, he advised on a number of nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded.[185] As chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race.[186]

The first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union in August 1949 came earlier than Americans expected, and over the next several months, there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities over whether to proceed with the development of the far more powerful, nuclear fusion–based hydrogen bomb, then known as "the Super".[187] Oppenheimer had been aware of the possibility of a thermonuclear weapon since the days of the Manhattan Project and had allocated a limited amount of theoretical research work toward the possibility at the time, but nothing more than that, given the pressing need to develop a fission weapon.[188] Immediately following the end of the war, Oppenheimer argued against continuing work on the Super at that time, due to both lack of need and the enormous human casualties that would result from its use.[189][190]

Now in October 1949, Oppenheimer and the GAC recommended against the development of the Super.[191] He and the other GAC members were motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be strategically used, resulting in millions of deaths: "Its use therefore carries much further than the atomic bomb itself the policy of exterminating civilian populations."[192] They also had practical qualms, as there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb at the time.[193] Regarding the possibility of the Soviet Union developing a thermonuclear weapon, the GAC felt that the United States could have an adequate stockpile of atomic weapons to retaliate against any thermonuclear attack.[194] In that connection, Oppenheimer and the others were concerned about the opportunity costs that would be incurred if nuclear reactors were diverted from materials needed for atom bomb production to the materials such as tritium needed for a thermonuclear weapon.[195][196]

A majority of the AEC subsequently endorsed the GAC recommendation, and Oppenheimer thought that the fight against the Super would triumph, but proponents of the weapon lobbied the White House vigorously.[197] On January 31, 1950, Truman, who was predisposed to proceed with the development of the weapon anyway, made the formal decision to do so.[198] Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James Conant, felt disheartened and considered resigning from the committee.[199] They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.[200]

In 1951, Teller and mathematician Stanislaw Ulam developed the Teller–Ulam design for a hydrogen bomb.[201] This new design seemed technically feasible and Oppenheimer officially acceded to the weapon's development,[202] while still looking for ways in which its testing or deployment or use could be questioned.[203] As he later recalled:

The program we had in 1949 was a tortured thing that you could well argue did not make a great deal of technical sense. It was therefore possible to argue also that you did not want it even if you could have it. The program in 1951 was technically so sweet that you could not argue about that. The issues became purely the military, the political and the humane problem of what you were going to do about it once you had it.[204]

Oppenheimer, Conant, and Lee DuBridge, another member who had opposed the H-bomb decision, left the GAC when their terms expired in August 1952.[205] Truman had declined to reappoint them, as he wanted new voices on the committee who were more in support of H-bomb development.[206] In addition, various opponents of Oppenheimer had communicated to Truman their desire that Oppenheimer leave the committee.[207]

Oppenheimer played a role on a number of government panels and study projects during the late 1940s and early 1950s, some of which thrust him into controversies and power struggles.[208]

In 1948, Oppenheimer chaired the Department of Defense's Long-Range Objectives Panel, a body created by AEC liaison Donald F. Carpenter.[209] It looked at the military utility of nuclear weapons, including how they might be delivered.[210] After a year's worth of study, in spring 1952, Oppenheimer wrote the draft report of Project GABRIEL, which examined the dangers of nuclear fallout.[211] Oppenheimer was also a member of the Science Advisory Committee of the Office of Defense Mobilization.[212]

Oppenheimer participated in Project Charles during 1951, which examined the possibility of creating an effective air defense of the United States against atomic attack, and in the follow-on Project East River in 1952, which, with Oppenheimer's input, recommended building a warning system that would provide one-hour notice of an impending atomic attack against American cities.[211] Those two projects led to Project Lincoln in 1952, a large effort on which Oppenheimer was one of the senior scientists.[211] Undertaken at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which had recently been founded to study issues of air defense, this in turn led to the Lincoln Summer Study Group, in which Oppenheimer became a key figure.[213] Oppenheimer's and other scientists' urging that resources be allocated to air defense in preference to large retaliatory strike capabilities brought an immediate response of objection from the United States Air Force (USAF),[214] and debate ensued about whether Oppenheimer and allied scientists, or the Air Force, was embracing an inflexible "Maginot Line" philosophy.[215] In any case, the Summer Study Group's work eventually led to the building of the Distant Early Warning Line.[216]

Teller, who had been so uninterested in work on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during the war that Oppenheimer had given him time instead to work on his own project of the hydrogen bomb,[217] left Los Alamos in 1951 to help found, in 1952, a second laboratory at what would become the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.[218] Oppenheimer had defended the history of work done at Los Alamos and opposed the creation of the second laboratory.[219]

Project Vista looked at improving U.S. tactical warfare capabilities.[211] Oppenheimer was a late addition to the project in 1951 but wrote a key chapter of the report that challenged the doctrine of strategic bombardment and advocated smaller tactical nuclear weapons which would be more useful in a limited theater conflict against enemy forces.[220] Strategic thermonuclear weapons delivered by long-range jet bombers would necessarily be under the control of the U.S. Air Force, whereas the Vista conclusions recommended an increased role for the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy as well.[221] The Air Force reaction to this was immediately hostile,[222] and it succeeded in getting the Vista report suppressed.[223]

During 1952, Oppenheimer chaired the five-member State Department Panel of Consultants on Disarmament,[224] which first urged that the United States postpone its planned first test of the hydrogen bomb and seek a thermonuclear test ban with the Soviet Union, on the grounds that avoiding a test might forestall the development of a catastrophic new weapon and open the way for new arms agreements between the two nations.[225] But the panel lacked political allies in Washington, and the Ivy Mike shot went ahead as scheduled.[224] The panel then issued a final report in January 1953, which, influenced by many of Oppenheimer's deeply felt beliefs, presented a pessimistic vision of the future in which neither the United States nor the Soviet Union could establish effective nuclear superiority but both sides could inflict terrible damage on the other.[226]

One of the panel's recommendations, which Oppenheimer felt was especially important,[227] was that the U.S. government practice less secrecy and more openness toward the American people about the realities of the nuclear balance and the dangers of nuclear warfare.[226] This notion found a receptive audience in the new Eisenhower administration and led to the creation of Operation Candor.[228] Oppenheimer subsequently presented his view on the lack of utility of ever-larger nuclear arsenals to the American public in a June 1953 article in Foreign Affairs,[229][230] and it received attention in major American newspapers.[231]

Thus by 1953, Oppenheimer had reached another peak of influence, being involved in multiple different government posts and projects and having access to crucial strategic plans and force levels.[115] But at the same time, he had become the enemy of the proponents of strategic bombardment, who viewed his opposition to the H-bomb, followed by these accumulated positions and stances, with a combination of bitterness and distrust.[232] This view was paired with their fear that Oppenheimer's fame and powers of persuasion had made him dangerously influential in government, military, and scientific circles.[233]

Security hearing
Main article: Oppenheimer security hearing

President Dwight D. Eisenhower receives a report from Lewis L. Strauss, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, on the Operation Castle hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific, March 30, 1954. Strauss pressed for Oppenheimer's security clearance to be revoked.
The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover had been following Oppenheimer since before the war, when he showed Communist sympathies as a professor at Berkeley and had been close to members of the Communist Party, including his wife and brother. They strongly suspected that he himself was a member of the party, based on wiretaps in which party members referred to him or appeared to refer to him as a communist, as well as reports from informers within the party.[234] He had been under close surveillance since the early 1940s, his home and office bugged, his phone tapped and his mail opened.[235]

In August 1943, Oppenheimer told Manhattan Project security agents that George Eltenton, whom he did not know, had solicited three men at Los Alamos for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union. When pressed on the issue in later interviews, Oppenheimer admitted that the only person who had approached him was his friend Haakon Chevalier, a Berkeley professor of French literature, who had mentioned the matter privately at a dinner at Oppenheimer's house.[236]

The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with evidence that intimated communist ties. These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier. Strauss had expressed opposition to exporting radioactive isotopes to other nations, and Oppenheimer had called them "less important than electronic devices but more important than, let us say, vitamins."[237]

On June 7, 1949, Oppenheimer testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee that he had associations with the Communist Party USA in the 1930s.[238] He testified that some of his students, including David Bohm, Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz, Philip Morrison, Bernard Peters, and Joseph Weinberg had been communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jackie testified before HUAC that they had been members of the Communist Party USA. Frank was subsequently fired from his University of Minnesota position. Unable to find work in physics for many years, he became a cattle rancher in Colorado. He later taught high school physics and was the founder of the San Francisco Exploratorium.[72][239]

The triggering event for the security hearing happened on November 7, 1953,[240] when William Liscum Borden, who until earlier in the year had been the executive director of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, sent Hoover a letter saying that "more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union."[241] Eisenhower never exactly believed the allegations in the letter but felt compelled to move forward with an investigation,[242] and on December 3, he ordered that a "blank wall" be placed between Oppenheimer and any government or military secrets.[243]

On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning by way of requesting termination of his consulting contract with the AEC.[244] Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead.[245] The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, general manager of the AEC.[246][247] Nichols, who had thought highly of Oppenheimer's work on the earlier Long-Range Objectives Panel,[209] said that "in spite of [Oppenheimer's] record he is loyal to the United States."[248] He nonetheless drafted the letter, but later wrote that he was "not happy with the inclusion of a reference concerning Oppenheimer's opposition to the hydrogen bomb development."[249]

The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was held in secret, focused on Oppenheimer's past communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or communist scientists.[250] It then continued with an examination of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb and stances in subsequent projects and study groups.[251] A transcript of the hearings was published in June 1954,[252] with some redactions. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Energy made the full transcript public.[253][254]

Head and shoulders portrait.
Oppenheimer's former colleague, Edward Teller, testified against Oppenheimer at his security hearing in 1954.[255]
One of the key elements in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.[256]

Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal to the U.S. government, but that:

In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act—I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted—in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more. In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands.[257]

Teller's testimony outraged the scientific community, and he was virtually ostracized from academic science.[258] Ernest Lawrence refused to testify, pleading an attack of ulcerative colitis, but an interview in which Lawrence condemned Oppenheimer was submitted in evidence.[259]

Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi said that the suspension of the security clearance was unnecessary: "he is a consultant, and if you don't want to consult the guy, you don't consult him, period."[260] But Groves testified that, under the stricter security criteria in effect in 1954, he "would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today".[261]

At the conclusion of the hearings, the board revoked Oppenheimer's clearance by a 2–1 vote.[262] It unanimously cleared him of disloyalty, but a majority found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially true and that Oppenheimer would represent a security risk.[263] Then on June 29, 1954, the AEC upheld the findings of the Personnel Security Board, by a 4–1 decision, with Strauss writing the majority opinion.[264] In that opinion, he stressed Oppenheimer's "defects of character", "falsehoods, evasions and misrepresentations", and past associations with Communists and people close to Communists as the primary reasons for his determination. He did not comment on Oppenheimer's loyalty.[265]

During his hearing, Oppenheimer testified on the left-wing activities of ten of his colleagues and previous acquaintances, mostly in reference to activities in the late 1930s.[266] These ten people's activities were already public knowledge through prior hearings and activities (such as Addis, Chevelier, Lambert, May, Pitman, and I. Folkoff) or already known to the FBI.[267] Some believe that had his clearance not been stripped, he might have been remembered as someone who "named names" to save his own reputation,[268] but as it happened, most in the scientific community saw him as a martyr to McCarthyism, an eclectic liberal unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific work from academia into the military.[269] Wernher von Braun told a Congressional committee: "In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted."[270]

In a seminar at The Wilson Center in 2009, based on an extensive analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr and Alexander Vassiliev confirmed that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviet Union, though Soviet intelligence tried repeatedly to recruit him. Further, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.[271] For their part, Jerrold and Leona Schecter conclude that based on The Merkulov Letter, Oppenheimer must have been only a "facilitator", not a spy in the strict sense (although he would fall under that legal category in the U.S.).[272]

On December 16, 2022, United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm vacated the 1954 revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance.[273] Her statement said, "In 1954, the Atomic Energy Commission revoked Dr. Oppenheimer's security clearance through a flawed process that violated the Commission's own regulations. As time has passed, more evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed."[274][273][275] Granholm's decision has drawn criticism.[276][277][278]

Final years
The frontiers of science are separated now by long years of study, by specialized vocabularies, arts, techniques, and knowledge from the common heritage even of a most civilized society; and anyone working at the frontier of such science is in that sense a very long way from home, a long way too from the practical arts that were its matrix and origin, as indeed they were of what we today call art.

Oppenheimer, "Prospects in the Arts and Sciences" in Man's Right to Knowledge[279]

Starting in 1954, Oppenheimer lived for several months of each year on the island of Saint John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 1957, he purchased a 2-acre (0.81 ha) tract of land on Gibney Beach, where he built a spartan home on the beach.[280] He spent considerable time sailing with his daughter Toni and wife Kitty.[281]

Oppenheimer's first public appearance following the stripping of his security clearance was a lecture titled "Prospects in the Arts and Sciences" for the Columbia University Bicentennial radio show Man's Right to Knowledge, in which he outlined his philosophy and his thoughts on the role of science in the modern world.[282][283] He had been selected for the final episode of the lecture series two years prior to the security hearing, though the university remained adamant that he stay on even after the controversy.[284]

In February 1955, the president of the University of Washington, Henry Schmitz, abruptly canceled an invitation to Oppenheimer to deliver a series of lectures there. Schmitz's decision caused an uproar among the students; 1,200 of them signed a petition protesting the decision, and Schmitz was burned in effigy. While they marched in protest, the state of Washington outlawed the Communist Party, and required all government employees to swear a loyalty oath. Edwin Albrecht Uehling, the chairman of the physics department and a colleague of Oppenheimer's from Berkeley, appealed to the university senate, and Schmitz's decision was overturned by a vote of 56 to 40. Oppenheimer stopped briefly in Seattle to change planes on a trip to Oregon and was joined for coffee during his layover by several University of Washington faculty, but Oppenheimer never lectured there.[285][286] Oppenheimer gave two lectures on the "Constitution of Matter" at Oregon State University during this trip.[287]

Oppenheimer was increasingly concerned about the danger that scientific inventions could pose to humanity. He joined with Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat, and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually, in 1960, become the World Academy of Art and Science. Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the Russell–Einstein Manifesto of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957.[288]

In his speeches and public writings, Oppenheimer continually stressed the difficulty of managing the power of knowledge in a world in which the freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer delivered the Reith Lectures on the BBC in 1953, which were subsequently published as Science and the Common Understanding.[289]

In 1955, Oppenheimer published The Open Mind, a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 on the subject of nuclear weapons and popular culture.[290] Oppenheimer rejected the idea of nuclear gunboat diplomacy. "The purposes of this country in the field of foreign policy", he wrote, "cannot in any real or enduring way be achieved by coercion."[290]

In 1957, the philosophy and psychology departments at Harvard invited Oppenheimer to deliver the William James Lectures. An influential group of Harvard alumni led by Edwin Ginn that included Archibald Roosevelt protested the decision.[290] 1,200 people attended Oppenheimer's six lectures, "The Hope of Order", in Sanders Theatre.[288] In 1962, Oppenheimer delivered the Whidden Lectures at McMaster University, which were published in 1964 as The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for Physicists.[291]

Deprived of political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work on physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks about the history of science, the role of science in society, and the nature of the universe.[292] Oppenheimer spoke about the importance of studying the history of science at the dedication of the Niels Bohr Library and Archives of the American Institute of Physics in September 1963.[293][294]

Oppenheimer continued to visit academic institutions throughout his final years. He remained a controversial figure to students, faculty, and communities. In November 1955, Oppenheimer became the inaugural week-long visiting fellow at the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.[295]

In September 1957, France made Oppenheimer an Officer of the Legion of Honor,[296] and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain.[297][298]

Enrico Fermi Award
In 1959, then-Senator John F. Kennedy voted to deny Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer's greatest detractor in his security hearings, confirmation as Secretary of Commerce, effectively ending Strauss's political career. In 1962, Kennedy―now President of the United States―invited Oppenheimer to a ceremony honoring 49 Nobel Prize winners. At the event, AEC chairman Glenn Seaborg asked Oppenheimer whether he wanted another security hearing. Oppenheimer declined.[299]

In March 1963, the General Advisory committee of the AEC selected Oppenheimer to receive its Enrico Fermi Award, an award Congress had created in 1954.[299] Kennedy was assassinated before he could present the award to Oppenheimer, but his successor, Lyndon Johnson, did so in a December 1963 ceremony at which he cited Oppenheimer's "contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, [and] leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years."[300] He called the signing of the award one of Kennedy's greatest acts as president.[301] Oppenheimer told Johnson, "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today."[301][302]

Kennedy's widow, Jackie, made a point of attending the ceremony so she could tell Oppenheimer how much her husband had wanted him to have the medal.[300] Also present were Teller, who had recommended Oppenheimer receive the award in hopes that it would heal the rift between them,[303] and Henry D. Smyth, who in 1954 had been the lone dissenter from the AEC's 4–1 decision to define Oppenheimer as a security risk.

But congressional hostility to Oppenheimer lingered. Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper formally protested Oppenheimer's selection just eight days after Kennedy was killed,[299] and several Republican members of the House AEC Committee boycotted the ceremony.[304]

The rehabilitation represented by the award was symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend.[301]

Death
A chain smoker (of Chesterfields),[305] Oppenheimer was diagnosed with throat cancer in late 1965. After inconclusive surgery, he underwent unsuccessful radiation treatment and chemotherapy late in 1966. On February 18, 1967, he died in his sleep at his home in Princeton, aged 62 years.[181] A memorial service was held a week later at Alexander Hall on the campus of Princeton University.[306] The service was attended by 600 of his scientific, political, and military associates, including Bethe, Groves, Kennan, Lilienthal, Rabi, Smyth, and Wigner. His brother Frank and the rest of his family were there, as was the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the novelist John O'Hara, and George Balanchine, the director of the New York City Ballet. Bethe, Kennan and Smyth gave brief eulogies.[307] Oppenheimer's body was cremated and his ashes placed in an urn, which Kitty dropped into the sea within sight of the St. John beach house.[308]

In October 1972, Kitty died aged 62 from an intestinal infection complicated by a pulmonary embolism.[309] Oppenheimer's ranch in New Mexico was then inherited by their son Peter, and the beach property was inherited by their daughter Katherine "Toni" Oppenheimer Silber. Toni was refused security clearance for her chosen vocation as a United Nations translator after the FBI brought up the old charges against her father. In January 1977, three months after her second marriage ended, she hanged herself in the family beach house.[310] She left the property to "the people of St. John for a public park and recreation area."[311] The house was built too close to the coast and was destroyed by a hurricane. As of 2007, the Virgin Islands Government maintained a Community Center nearby.[312]

When Oppenheimer was stripped of his political influence in 1954, he symbolized for many the folly of scientists who believed they could control the use of their research, and the dilemmas of moral responsibility presented by science in the nuclear age.[313] The hearings were motivated by politics and personal enmities, and reflected a stark divide in the nuclear weapons community.[314] One group passionately feared the Soviet Union as a mortal enemy, and believed having the most powerful weaponry capable of providing the most massive retaliation was the best strategy to combat that threat. The other group thought developing the H-bomb would not improve Western security and that using the weapon against large civilian populations would be genocide; they advocated instead a more flexible response to the Soviets involving tactical nuclear weapons, strengthened conventional forces, and arms control agreements. The first of these groups was the more powerful in political terms, and Oppenheimer became its target.[315][316]

Rather than consistently oppose the "Red-baiting" of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against former colleagues and students, before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end, it became a liability when it became clear Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters's loyalty, and recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory.[317]

Popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (represented by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (represented by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of weapons of mass destruction.[318] Biographers and historians have often viewed Oppenheimer's story as a tragedy.[319][320][321] National security advisor and academic McGeorge Bundy, who worked with Oppenheimer on the State Department Panel of Consultants, wrote: "Quite aside from Oppenheimer's extraordinary rise and fall in prestige and power, his character has fully tragic dimensions in its combination of charm and arrogance, intelligence and blindness, awareness and insensitivity, and perhaps above all daring and fatalism. All these, in different ways, were turned against him in the hearings."[321]

The question of scientists' responsibility toward humanity inspired Bertolt Brecht's drama Life of Galileo (1955), left its imprint on Friedrich Dürrenmatt's The Physicists, and is the basis of John Adams's 2005 opera Doctor Atomic, which was commissioned to portray Oppenheimer as a modern-day Faust. Heinar Kipphardt's play In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer, after appearing on West German television, had its theatrical release in Berlin and Munich in October 1964. The 1967 Finnish television film Oppenheimerin tapaus (The Case of Oppenheimer) is based on the same play and produced by the Yleisradio company.[322][323] Oppenheimer's objections resulted in an exchange of correspondence with Kipphardt, in which Kipphardt offered to make corrections but defended the play.[324] It premiered in New York in 1968, with Joseph Wiseman as Oppenheimer. New York Times theater critic Clive Barnes called it an "angry play and a partisan play" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed him as a "tragic fool and genius."[325] Oppenheimer had difficulty with this portrayal. After reading a transcript of Kipphardt's play soon after it began to be performed, Oppenheimer threatened to sue Kipphardt, decrying "improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved."[326] Later Oppenheimer told an interviewer:

The whole damn thing [his security hearing] was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it. ... I had never said that I had regretted participating in a responsible way in the making of the bomb. I said that perhaps he [Kipphardt] had forgotten Guernica, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, Dachau, Warsaw, and Tokyo; but I had not, and that if he found it so difficult to understand, he should write a play about something else.[327]

Oppenheimer is the subject of many biographies, including American Prometheus (2005) by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, which won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.[328] The 1980 BBC TV serial Oppenheimer, starring Sam Waterston, won 3 BAFTA Television Awards.[329] The Day After Trinity, a 1980 documentary about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb, was nominated for an Academy Award and received a Peabody Award.[330][331] Oppenheimer's life is explored in Tom Morton-Smith's 2015 play Oppenheimer,[332] and the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy, where he was portrayed by Dwight Schultz.[333] Also in 1989, David Strathairn played Oppenheimer in the TV film Day One.[334] In the 2023 American film Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan and based on American Prometheus, Oppenheimer is portrayed by actor Cillian Murphy.[335] The film won the Academy Award for best picture, and Murphy won for best actor.[336]

A centennial conference about Oppenheimer's legacy was held in 2004 at the University of California, Berkeley, alongside a digital exhibition on his life,[337] with the conference proceedings published in 2005 as Reappraising Oppenheimer: Centennial Studies and Reflections.[338] His papers are in the Library of Congress.[339]

As a scientist, Oppenheimer was remembered by his students and colleagues as a brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who founded modern theoretical physics in the United States. "More than any other man", Bethe wrote, "he was responsible for raising American theoretical physics from a provincial adjunct of Europe to world leadership."[340] Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize,[341] though his investigations contributing to the theory of black holes might have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought to fruition by later astrophysicists.[111] An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor on January 4, 2000,[342] as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer in 1970.[343]

As a military and public policy advisor, Oppenheimer was a leader in the shift toward technocracy in the interactions between science and the military, and in the emergence of "big science". During World War II, scientists became involved in military research to an unprecedented degree. Because of the threat fascism posed to Western civilization, they volunteered in great numbers for technological, and organizational, assistance to the Allied effort, resulting in powerful tools such as radar, the proximity fuze and operations research. As a cultured, intellectual, theoretical physicist who became a disciplined military organizer, Oppenheimer represented the shift away from the idea that scientists had their "heads in the clouds" and that knowledge of esoteric subjects like the composition of the atomic nucleus had no "real-world" applications.[313]

Two days before the Trinity test, Oppenheimer expressed his hopes and fears in a quotation from Bhartṛhari's Śatakatraya:

In battle, in the forest, at the precipice in the mountains,
On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,
In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,
The good deeds a man has done before defend him.[344][345]

Notes
 Oppenheimer's birth certificate reads "Julius Robert Oppenheimer,"[1][2] his college transcript "J Robert Oppenheimer."[3] Oppenheimer himself said the J stood for nothing, and his brother Frank "surmised that the J was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a 'junior.'"[4]
 Oppenheimer already had three PhD students who had commenced under another supervisor: Harvey Hall and J. Franklin Carlson under William Howell Williams; and Leo Nedelsky, who had started under Samuel K. Allison. In 1931, Hall became the first of Oppenheimer's students to complete his PhD.[54]
 Oppenheimer's other doctoral students: Arnold Nordsieck, Glen Camp, Willis Lamb, Samuel Batdorf, Sydney Dancroft, George Volkoff, Philip Morrison, Hartland Snyder, Joseph Keller, Robert Christy, Eugene Cooper, Shichi Kusaka, Richard Dempster, Roy Thomas, Eldred Nelson, Bernard Peters, Edward Gerjuoy, Stanley Frankel, Chaim Richman, Joseph Weinberg, David Bohm, Leslie Foldy, Harold Lewis and Siegfried Wouthuysen.[56]
 He also spoke Dutch, German, French and some Chinese.[99]
 "If the radiance ..." is Bhagavad Gita verse XI,12 (divi sūryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitā / yadi bhāḥ sadṛṥī sā syādbhāsastasya mahātmanaḥ);[155][156] "Now I am become Death ..." is verse XI,32.(kālo'smi lokakṣayakṛtpravṛddho lokānsamāhartumiha pravṛttaḥ) Oppenheimer had read the Bhagavad Gita in the original Sanskrit, and the translation is his own.[157][158] In the literature, "shatterer" is usually given rather than "destroyer," because "shatterer" appears in the first printed rendition of Oppenheimer's anecdote (in Time magazine, November 8, 1948).[31] The "shatterer" version later appeared in Robert Jungk's Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists (1958),[159] which was based on an interview with Oppenheimer.[160]
 Due to the subsequent development of the Standard Model, the muon is now considered to be a lepton and not a meson.[180]

The Zone of Interest is a 2023 historical drama film written and directed by Jonathan Glazer, co-produced between the United Kingdom and Poland. Loosely based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis, the film focuses on the life of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss and his wife Hedwig, who live with their family in a home in the "Zone of Interest" next to the concentration camp. Christian Friedel stars as Rudolf Höss alongside Sandra Hüller as Hedwig Höss.[3]

Development of the film began in 2014 around the publication of the Amis novel, which is itself based partially on real events. Glazer opted to tell the story of the Hösses rather than the characters they inspired and conducted extensive research into the family, as he sought to make a film that demystifies the perpetrators of the Holocaust. The project was formally announced in 2019, with A24 confirmed to distribute the film. Filming took place primarily around Auschwitz in summer 2021.

The Zone of Interest premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival on 19 May 2023 and was theatrically released in the United States on 15 December 2023. The film received critical acclaim with praise towards Glazer's direction and script, the minimal use of music, sound design, cinematography, experimental narrative and atmosphere. Among its accolades, The Zone of Interest received five nominations (including Best Picture) at the 96th Academy Awards, winning two for Best International Feature (the first for a non-English British film) and Best Sound.[7] The film also won the Grand Prix at Cannes and three British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film Not in the English Language,[8] received three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards, and was named one of the top five international films of 2023 by the National Board of Review.

Plot
The film opens on a black screen with a dark crimson spot.

In 1943, Rudolf Höss, commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, lives with his wife Hedwig and their five children in an idyllic home next to the camp. Höss takes the children out to swim and fish, and Hedwig spends time tending the garden. Camp prisoners handle the chores, and the deportees' belongings are given to the family. Beyond the garden wall, gunshots, shouting, and sounds of trains and furnaces are audible.

Höss approves the design of a new crematorium created by Topf and Sons. One day, after noticing human remains in the river, he gets his children out of the water and sends a coded note to camp personnel, chastising them for their carelessness. At night, while Höss reads the German fairytale of "Hansel and Gretel" to his daughters, a Polish girl sneaks out and hides food at the prisoners' work sites.

Höss receives word that he is being promoted to deputy inspector of concentration camps and must move to Oranienburg, near Berlin. He objects, and withholds the news from Hedwig for several days. Hedwig asks him to convince his superiors to let her and the children remain in their home; the request is approved. Before Höss leaves, a woman comes to his office and prepares herself for sex. Hedwig's mother comes to stay, but departs after seeing the burning crematorium at night. She leaves a note that upsets Hedwig.

In Berlin, in recognition of his work, Höss is tasked by Oswald Pohl with heading an operation named after him that will transport 700,000 Hungarian Jews to work or be killed. This allows him to move back to Auschwitz and reunite with his family. He vacantly attends a party organised by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office. Afterwards, he tells Hedwig over the phone that he spent his time at the party thinking about the most efficient way to gas the attendees.

As Höss leaves his Berlin office and descends a stairway, he stops, retches repeatedly and stares into the darkness of the building corridors. In the present day, a group of janitors clean the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Back in 1943, Höss continues downstairs without retching and descends further into the darkness.

The film closes on the same black screen that was seen at the beginning.

Development




Clockwise: writer-director Jonathan Glazer, novelist Martin Amis, and actors Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel
Development of The Zone of Interest began in 2014.[9] After completing Under the Skin, Glazer came across a newspaper preview of the then not-yet-published Martin Amis novel The Zone of Interest and became intrigued. He optioned the novel after reading it. Paul and Hannah Doll, the novel's two main characters, were loosely based on Rudolf Höss, the longest-serving commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, and his wife Hedwig. Glazer opted to use the historical figures instead and conducted two years of extensive research into the Hösses.[10] He made several visits to Auschwitz and was profoundly affected by the sight of the Höss residence, which was separated from the camp by a mere garden wall.[11] He collaborated with the Auschwitz Museum and other organisations, and obtained special permission to access the archives, where he examined testimonies provided by survivors and individuals who had been employed in the Höss household. By piecing together these testimonies, Glazer gradually constructed a detailed portrayal of the individuals connected to the events.[12][13] He also consulted historian Timothy Snyder's 2015 book Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning during his research.[10]

Glazer wished to make a film that demystifies the perpetrators of the Holocaust, which he noted are often portrayed as "almost mythologically evil". He sought to tell the story of the Holocaust not "as something safely in the past", but "a story of the here and now".[9][14] He compared his approach to the writing of philosopher Gillian Rose, who envisioned a film "that could make us feel 'unsafe', by showing how we're emotionally and politically closer to the perpetrator culture than we'd like to think" and a film seen through the "dry eyes of grief" that is unsentimental and "forensic".[15]

Glazer confirmed development of the project in 2019, with A24, Film4, Access Entertainment and House Productions co-financing and producing.[16][17] Friedel first met Glazer and producer Jim Wilson in London in 2019 for the role of Rudolf Höss. Despite his own unwillingness to play Nazi figures, he was intrigued by Glazer's approach, which aimed to "give this monstrous person a human face". Friedel recommended Hüller for the role of Rudolf's wife Hedwig, having first met her in 2013 while acting together in the historical drama Amour Fou.[14][18] Hüller was first sent an excerpt of the script, an argument between Rudolf and Hedwig presented out of context, before learning the project's nature as a film about the Holocaust. Although she had resolved never to play a Nazi, Hüller was convinced after reading the full script and meeting with Glazer, believing that he shared and addressed her concerns about how to properly depict Nazism on screen. Hüller's own dog, a black Weimeraner, plays Dilla, the Höss family dog in the film.[19]

The young Polish girl in the film is inspired by Aleksandra Bystroń-Kołodziejczyk, whom Glazer met during his research. As a 12-year-old member of the Polish Home Army, she used to cycle to the camp to leave apples for the starving prisoners. As in the film, she discovered a piece of music written by a prisoner. The prisoner, Joseph Wulf, worked at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. He survived the camp and was one of the first people to document the atrocities of the Holocaust, a cause to which he dedicated his life. Bystroń-Kołodziejczyk died shortly after she met Glazer. The bike the film uses and the dress the actress wears both belonged to her.[9][20] Glazer dedicated the film to her while accepting the award for Best International Feature Film at the 96th Academy Awards.[21]

Filming

The original Höss house has been a private residence since the end of the war.[10] Wear and tear in the subsequent eight decades made it a poor location for the shoot, which required the house to appear brand new. Production designer Chris Oddy ultimately chose a derelict building a few hundred yards away, built after the war but in a similar architectural style.[14] He spent several months converting the home into a replica of the Höss residence, and started planting the garden in April 2021 so that it would be in bloom when filming began.[10] As the camp buildings have aged significantly over the years, they were recreated through the use of computer-generated graphics.[22] Principal photography began in Auschwitz in summer 2021 and lasted approximately 55 days.[10][11] Additional filming took place in Jelenia Góra in January 2022.[23]

The film was shot on Sony Venice digital cameras equipped with Leica lenses.[24] Glazer and cinematographer Łukasz Żal embedded up to 10 cameras in and around the house and kept them running simultaneously, with no crew on set. Żal and his team were stationed in the basement, while Glazer and the rest of the crew were in a container on the other side of the wall, away from the actors. Each take would last 10 minutes. The approach, which Glazer dubbed "Big Brother in the Nazi house", allowed the actors to improvise and experiment extensively during filming.[10][11][13][14] Glazer and Żal aimed for a modern look and did not wish to "aesthetize" Auschwitz. As a result, only practical and natural lighting was used.[25] The nighttime sequences involving the Polish girl, where there was no natural light available, were shot using a forward-looking infrared camera provided by the Polish military. The low-resolution thermal imagery was then upscaled using AI during post-production.[20][14]

Glazer did not want the atrocities occurring inside the camp to be seen, only heard. He described the film's sound as "the other film" and "arguably, the film".[11] To that end, sound designer Johnnie Burn compiled a 600-page document containing relevant events at Auschwitz, testimonies from witnesses, and a large map of the camp so that the distance and echoes of the sounds could be properly determined.[26] He spent a year building a sound library before filming began, which included sounds of manufacturing machinery, crematoria, furnaces, boots, period-accurate gunfire and human sounds of pain. He continued building the library well into the shoot and post-production.[27][28] As many of the new arrivals at Auschwitz at the time were French, Burn sourced their voices from protests and riots in Paris in 2022. The sounds of drunken Auschwitz guards were sourced at the Reeperbahn in Hamburg.[29]

English musician Mica Levi wrote a score, most of which was ultimately cut as Glazer and Burn did not want to have the film sweetened or dramatized by it. The sound collages Levi wrote for the prologue and the epilogue remained, as did soundscapes created for the sequences involving the Polish girl.[30] The compositions combine human voices with a synthesizer, which Levi described as a pairing of "the oldest, most primordial instrument" with "the most modern".[14]

Release
The Zone of Interest was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival,[31] where it had its world premiere on 19 May,[32] and received a six-minute standing ovation.[33] It won the Grand Prix, the Cannes Soundtrack Award, and the FIPRESCI Prize.[34][35][36]

The North American premiere was held on 1 September 2023, at the 50th Telluride Film Festival.[37][38] The Zone of Interest was also screened at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.[39] In the US, after being delayed from its initial release date of 8 December,[40] The Zone of Interest had a limited theatrical release on 15 December.[41] It was released in the UK on 2 February 2024,[42] and released in Poland a week later on 9 February.[43] It was released for digital platforms on February 20.[44]

Jonathan Glazer's acceptance speech at the 96th Academy Awards
The film's release coincided with the ongoing 2023 Israeli invasion of Gaza, leading to its director, producer and other commentators to draw analogies between them. In his Oscar acceptance speech at the 96th Academy Awards, Glazer said The Zone of Interest shows where dehumanisation leads at its worst, stating that: "Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people". He expressed criticism, as a Jewish person, by referring to the dehumanisation of both the "victims of October the 7th in Israel" and "the ongoing attack on Gaza".[45][46]

Glazer's speech led to a significant reaction in the media, especially due to a widely circulated misquotation which stated that Glazer had simply refuted his Jewishness, rather than refuting said Jewishness "being hijacked by an occupation."[47] Producer James Wilson said at the British Academy Film Awards: "I had a friend that texted me the other day, he said he couldn’t stop thinking about the walls we build in our daily lives that we don’t choose... There’s obviously things going on in the world, in Gaza, that remind us starkly of the sort of selective empathy, that there seems to be groups of innocent people being killed that we care about less than other innocent people."[48] Critic David Klion wrote that watching the film "...as U.S.-made bombs rained down on civilian neighborhoods in Gaza, I couldn’t help but dwell on the banal acceptance of these mass civilian casualties that I’ve witnessed closer to home."[49]

On March 18, an open letter denouncing the speech as blood libel signed by more than 450 "Jewish creatives, executives and Hollywood professionals" including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gary Gilbert, Rod Lurie and Michael Rapaport was released.[50] However, the speech also saw defence and praise from screenwriters Tony Kushner and Zoe Kazan.[51][52]

Reception
Box office
As of March 21, 2024, The Zone of Interest has grossed $8.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $25.2 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $37.7 million.[5][6]

In its opening weekend in the United States, the film made $124,000 from four theatres.[53] Following its five Oscar nominations, it expanded from 215 theatres to 333 in its seventh week of release and made $1.08 million, an increase of 141% from the previous weekend, and a running total of $3 million.[54]

Critical response
The Zone of Interest premiered to critical acclaim.[a] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 330 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's critics consensus states, "Dispassionately examining the ordinary existence of people complicit in horrific crimes, The Zone of Interest forces us to take a cold look at the mundanity behind an unforgivable brutality."[62] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 58 critic reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[63]

Kevin Maher of The Times called it a "landmark movie, hugely important, that's unafraid of difficult ideas".[64] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it a "devastating Holocaust drama like no other, which demonstrates with startling effectiveness [director Jonathan Glazer]'s unerring control of tonal and visual storytelling".[65] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times wrote, "Glazer may yet get in some trouble for taking such a formal approach to sensitive material. But, if anything, that self-imposed discipline – and utter lack of sentimentality – speaks to the profound respect he has for the subject."[66] Raphael Abraham of the Financial Times wrote, "Glazer has achieved something much greater than just making the monstrous mundane — by rendering such extreme inhumanity ordinary he reawakens us to its true horror."[67] Jonathan Romney of Screen International wrote that the film "eschews false rhetoric, leaving maximum space for the audience's imaginative and emotional response".[68]

David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised Glazer's camera process for instilling "a flattening evenness into a film where the lack of drama becomes deeply sickening unto itself".[69] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, "Through painstaking framing and sound design, its horrors gnaw at the edge of every shot."[70] In a four-star review, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it "a film which for all its artistry is perhaps not entirely in control of its (intentional) bad taste", while also praising the "superb score by Mica Levi and sound design by Johnnie Burn".[71]

Writing for Worldcrunch, the German critic Hanns-Georg Rodek wrote: "Here's the first question The Zone of Interest doesn't answer: [is it a film that showcases] ignorance? Of course it isn't. [Does it show] conscious approval based on racist and nationalist delusion? I'm sure it [does]. Is it longing for an idyll in the midst of a situation perceived as threatening? Without a doubt. There are many attempts at an explanation, but they don't really interest Jonathan Glazer. Glazer describes the situation in what is possibly more oppressive than anything we've seen in Holocaust films before. It concentrates in one garden the attitude of an entire nation that wanted to know nothing."[72]

The filmmaker Steven Spielberg said The Zone of Interest was the best film about the Holocaust since his film Schindler's List (1993), and said: "It's doing a lot of good work in raising awareness, especially about the banality of evil."[73][74] The filmmaker Todd Field said: "For those familiar with Glazer's films it's no surprise his approach here is unencumbered by tropes, genre conceits, or the cinematic shorthand we often take for granted. Over his twenty-four-year career as one of our finest filmmakers, Glazer has consistently executed high-wire interpretations of genre, and in the process completely reinvented them: crime (Sexy Beast), the paranormal (Birth), science fiction (Under the Skin). His pictures within these frames are mind-blowingly unique, as if he’d never seen anything that had been done before."[75]

Conversely, the Italian film critic Davide Abbatescianni's review published by Cineuropa was less positive. He criticised the film for its disturbing atmosphere, which he found to be well-crafted but monotonous, and for the performances, which he felt could not bring any change to the concept presented in a film that he thought lacked variety and remained stagnant for two hours.[76] Richard Brody from The New Yorker wrote "the movie is an extreme form of Holokitsch; it's this year's Jojo Rabbit."[77] Among the other rare negative reviews, Les Cahiers du Cinéma, found, "The problem is not only the weakness of (the film's) formal lurches, which are much more derisory than those of Under The Skin, and remain here at the stage of mannerisms (why dispense them in such a furtive manner, if not to frustrate needlessly?). It’s also that this fantastic idea of off-camera poisoning the frame without ever showing the forbidden image ends up running empty and looking at itself."[78] "After largely ecstatic reviews in the English-speaking world, German audiences have been more ambivalent about Jonathan Glazer’s film", commented The Irish Times.[79] Writing for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, however, Andreas Klib stated that "Here the camera repeatedly jumps over the axis between the characters -a deadly sin in illusion cinema- to show the back of the event. Because we are not supposed to take part in it, but rather pay attention to details: the clouds of steam from a locomotive on the horizon. The smoke rising from the crematorium into the evening air. The reddish glow of the night sky. The ash that fertilizes the rose beds. At Cannes, where “The Zone of Interest” won the Grand Jury Prize, some critics criticized the film for its lack of storytelling.

Christopher Edward Nolan CBE (born 30 July 1970) is a British and American filmmaker. Known for his Hollywood blockbusters with complex storytelling, Nolan is considered a leading filmmaker of the 21st century. His films have grossed more than $6 billion worldwide, ranking him amongst the highest-grossing directors. His accolades include two Academy Awards. In 2015, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time, and in 2024, he was honoured with the British Film Institute Fellowship.

Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002). He became a high-profile director with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), and found further success with The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). Parting ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, Nolan signed with Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller Oppenheimer (2023), which won him Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.

Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.

Early life
Christopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive of Irish descent [1] who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, was an American flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three brothers were raised Catholic in Highgate and would spend their summers in Evanston.[2][3] Nolan holds both UK and US citizenship.[4]

Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Ridley Scott and the science fiction films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977).[6][7] He would repeatedly watch the latter film and extensively research its making.[8] Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[9] These films included a stop motion animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from "clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls".[6] His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: "I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice", Nolan later remarked.[10] From the age of 11, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.[11] Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Witley, Surrey.[12] In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co-directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service.[a][14][15] After a fan posted a copy of Tarantella online, in 2021, Nolan's production company filed a copyright infringement claim, to have the film removed.[16]

Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later studied English literature at University College London (UCL). Opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued "a degree in something unrelated", which his father suggested "gives a different take on things".[17] He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16 mm film cameras.[18] Nolan was president of the Union's Film Society,[18] and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened feature films in 35mm during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers.[19]

Career
1993–2003: Early career and breakthrough
After earning his bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator and director of corporate films and industrial films.[18][20][21] He directed, wrote and edited the short film Larceny (1996),[22] which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew.[14][23] Funded by Nolan and shot with the UCL Union Film society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.[24] For unknown reasons, the film has since been removed from public view.[22] Nolan filmed a third short, Doodlebug (1997), about a man seemingly chasing an insect with his shoe, only to discover that it is a miniature of himself.[17][25]

Nolan and Thomas first attempted to make a feature in the mid-1990s titled Larry Mahoney, which they scrapped.[26] During this period in his career, Nolan had little to no success getting his projects off the ground, facing several rejections; he added, "[T]here's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place ... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry."[27]

Shortly after abandoning Larry Mahoney, Nolan conceived the idea for his first feature, Following (1998), which he wrote, directed, photographed and edited. The film depicts an unemployed young writer (Jeremy Theobald) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. It was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his apartment burgled; he observed that the common attribute between larceny and pursuing someone through a crowd was that they both cross social boundaries.[28] Co-produced by Nolan with Thomas and Theobald,[29] it was made on a budget of around £3,000. Most of the cast and crew were friends of Nolan, and shooting took place on weekends over the course of a year.[30] To conserve film stock, each scene was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit.[17][31] Following won several awards during its festival run and was well received by critics who labelled Nolan a majorly talented debutant.[32][33] Scott Timberg of New Times LA wrote that it "echoed Hitchcock classics", but was "leaner and meaner".[34] Janet Maslin of The New York Times was impressed with its "spare look" and "agile hand-held camerawork", saying, "As a result, the actors convincingly carry off the before, during and after modes that the film eventually, and artfully, weaves together."[35]

"The difference between shooting Following with a group of friends wearing our own clothes and my mum making sandwiches to spending $4 million of somebody else's money on Memento and having a crew of a hundred people is, to this day, by far the biggest leap I've ever made."

—Nolan on the jump from his first film to his second (2012)[36]

Following's success afforded Nolan the opportunity to make Memento (2000), which became his breakthrough film. His brother Jonathan pitched the idea to him, about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Jonathan worked the idea into a short story, "Memento Mori" (2001), and Nolan developed it into a screenplay that told the story in reverse. Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was "perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen".[37] The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5 million, with Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss in the starring roles.[38] Newmarket also distributed the film after it was rejected by studios who feared that it would not attract a wide audience. Following a positive word of mouth and screenings in 500 theatres, it earned $40 million.[39] Memento premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2000 to critical acclaim.[40] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote in his review, "I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time."[41] In the book The Philosophy of Neo-Noir, Basil Smith drew a comparison with John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities – a theme Nolan explores in the film.[42] Memento earned Nolan many accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, as well as two Independent Spirit Awards: Best Director and Best Screenplay.[43][44] Six critics listed it as one of the best films of the 2000s.[45] In 2001, Nolan and Emma Thomas founded the production company Syncopy Inc.[46][b]

Impressed by his work on Memento, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh recommended Nolan to Warner Bros. to direct the psychological thriller Insomnia (2002), although the studio initially wanted a more seasoned director.[48] A remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name, the film is viewed as "the outlier of Nolan's filmography" due to its perceived lack of unconventionality he is known for.[49] Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank,[50] Insomnia follows two Los Angeles detectives sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager. It received positive reviews from critics and earned $113 million against a budget of $46 million.[51][52] Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt, adding, "Unlike most remakes, the Nolan Insomnia is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play."[53] Richard Schickel of Time deemed Insomnia a "worthy successor" to Memento and "a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery".[54]

Following, Memento and Insomnia established Nolan's image as an "auteur".[55] After the lattermost, he wrote a screenplay for a Howard Hughes biopic. Nolan reluctantly tabled his script after learning that Martin Scorsese was already making one such film: The Aviator (2004).[56] He was then briefly attached to direct a film adaptation of Ruth Rendell's novel The Keys to the Street for Fox Searchlight Pictures but chose to direct Batman Begins instead.[57] Nolan turned down an offer to direct the historical epic Troy (2004).[58] In April 2003, filmmaker David O. Russell put Nolan in a headlock at a Hollywood party after learning that Jude Law, whom Russell wanted to cast, had decided to work with Nolan instead. Russell pressured Nolan to display "artistic solidarity" by relinquishing Law from his cast.[59][60]

2003–2013: Widespread recognition
In early 2003, Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the idea of making a new Batman film, based on the character's origin story.[61] Nolan was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world than a comic-book fantasy.[62] He relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects during filming, with minimal use of computer-generated imagery (CGI).[63] Batman Begins (2005), the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point,[64] was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.[65][66] Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman—along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson—Batman Begins revived the franchise.[67][68] Batman Begins was 2005's ninth-highest-grossing film and was praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance;[66][69] it is cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s.[70] Film author Ian Nathan wrote that within five years of his career, Nolan "[went] from unknown to indie darling to gaining creative control over one of the biggest properties in Hollywood, and (perhaps unwittingly) fomenting the genre that would redefine the entire industry".[71]

Nolan directed, co-wrote and produced The Prestige (2006), an adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel about two rival 19th-century magicians.[72] The screenplay was the result of an intermittent, five-year collaboration between him and his brother Jonathan, who had begun writing it already in 2001. Nolan initially intended to make the film as early as 2003, but had postponed the project after agreeing to make Batman Begins.[73][74] Starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the lead roles of rival magicians, The Prestige received critical acclaim and received two Academy Award nominations.[75][76] Roger Ebert described it as "quite a movie – atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic",[77] and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it an "ambitious, unnerving melodrama".[78] The Guardian's Philip French wrote: "In addition to the intellectual or philosophical excitement it engenders, The Prestige is gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny."[79] Despite a negative box-office prognosis, the film earned over $109 million against a budget of $40 million.[80]

The Dark Knight (2008), the follow-up to Batman Begins, was Nolan's next venture. Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[81] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on "the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals".[82] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[83][84] The Dark Knight has been ranked as one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever made.[c] Many critics declare The Dark Knight to be "the most successful comic book film ever made".[89] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found the film to be of higher artistic merit than many Hollywood blockbusters: "Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind."[90] Ebert expressed a similar point of view, describing it as a "haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy".[91] The Dark Knight set many box-office records during its theatrical run,[92] earning over $1 billion worldwide.[93] At the 81st Academy Awards, the film was nominated in eight categories, winning two: Best Sound Editing for Richard King and a posthumous Best Supporting Actor award for Heath Ledger.[94] The film's failure to garner a Best Picture nomination was criticised by the media. Beginning in 2010, the Academy increased their Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as "The Dark Knight Rule".[95] Nolan received many awards and nominations for his work on the film.[43] In the late 2000s, Nolan was reported to direct a film adaptation of the 1960s television series The Prisoner.[57][96]

The success of The Dark Knight allowed Warner Bros. to sign Nolan to write, direct and co-produce Inception (2010) – a film for which he had the idea around nine years before its release.[97] Nolan described the film as "a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind".[98] Starring a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film became a critical and commercial success upon its release.[99] Film critic Mark Kermode named it the best film of 2010, stating "Inception is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing."[100] Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that "Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[101] The film grossed over $836 million worldwide.[102] Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[103] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[43]

Christopher Nolan is looking directly towards the camera.

Around the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: "In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism."[104] After initial hesitation, Nolan agreed to return to direct The Dark Knight Rises and worked with his brother and David S. Goyer to develop a story that he felt would end the trilogy on a high note.[105] The film was released to positive reviews.[106] Kenneth Turan found the film "potent, persuasive and hypnotic" and "more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard".[107] Christy Lemire of HuffPost wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a "typically spectacular, ambitious fashion", but disliked the "overloaded" story and excessive grimness.[108] The Dark Knight Rises was a box office success, becoming the thirteenth film to gross $1 billion.[109] During a midnight showing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.[110] Nolan released a statement expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a "senseless tragedy".[111]

The Dark Knight trilogy inspired a trend in future superhero films seeking to replicate its gritty, realistic tone to little success. The second instalment in particular revitalised the genre at a time when recent superhero films had failed to meet expectations.[112][113] Ben Child of The Guardian wrote that the three films "will remain thrilling totems of the genre for decades to come".[112] During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises, Goyer told Nolan of his idea about Man of Steel (2013), which the latter would produce.[114] Impressed with Zack Snyder's work in 300 (2006) and Watchmen (2009), Nolan hired him to direct the film.[115] Starring Henry Cavill as Clark Kent who learns that he is a powerful alien, Man of Steel received mixed reviews and grossed more than $660 million against a budget of $220 million.[116][117]

2014–2019: Interstellar, Dunkirk and other activities

Nolan and his younger brother, Jonathan (pictured in 2017), wrote several screenplays together, including that of Interstellar.
Nolan next directed, wrote and produced the science-fiction film Interstellar (2014). The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg.[118] Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.[119] In a 2014 discussion of the film's physics, Nolan expressed his admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied "in every aspect of our civilisation".[120] Interstellar – starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain – was released to positive reviews and grossed $773 million worldwide.[121][122] Observing its "visual dazzle, thematic ambition", The New York Times's A. O. Scott wrote that Interstellar is a "sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret".[123] Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers called the film "a real work of art" and praised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations.[124] Interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two academic papers.[125][126] The American Journal of Physics called for it to be shown in school science lessons.[127][128] At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominations.[129] Also in 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas served as executive producers on Transcendence, the directorial debut of his longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister.[130]

In the mid-2010s, Nolan took part in several ventures for film preservation and distribution of the work of lesser-known filmmakers. His production company, Syncopy, formed a joint venture with Zeitgeist Films to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist's films.[131] As a part of the Blu-ray release of the animation films of the Brothers Quay, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay (2015). He initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' In Absentia, The Comb and Street of Crocodiles. IndieWire wrote that the brothers "will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that The Quay Brothers in 35mm will always be one of [the] latter's most important contributions to cinema".[132][133] An advocate for the survival of the analogue medium, Nolan and visual artist Tacita Dean invited representatives from leading American film archives, laboratories and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled Reframing the Future of Film at the Getty Museum in March 2015.[134][135] Subsequent events were held at Tate Modern in London, Museo Tamayo in Mexico City and Tata Theatre in Mumbai.[136] In April 2015, Nolan joined the board of directors of The Film Foundation, a non-profitable organisation dedicated to film preservation,[137] and was appointed, along with Martin Scorsese, by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board as DGA representatives.[138] Nolan serves on the Motion Picture & Television Fund Board of Governors.[139]

After serving as an executive producer on Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017),[140][141] Nolan returned to directing with Dunkirk (2017). Based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with Thomas, the film is set amid World War II in 1940 and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a "sensory, almost experimental movie" with minimal dialogue.[142] He said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film but with an American budget.[143] Before filming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, "knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama".[144] Starring an ensemble cast,[145] Dunkirk was released to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results.[146][147][148] It grossed over $526 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time.[149] In his review, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie."[150] The film received many accolades, including Nolan's first Oscar nomination for Best Director.[151]

In 2018, Nolan supervised a new 70 mm print of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), made from the original camera negative; he presented it at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.[152] USA Today observed that festival-goers greeted Nolan "like a rock star with a standing ovation".[153] A year later, Nolan and Thomas received executive producer credits on The Doll's Breath (2019), an animated short directed by the Quay brothers.[154]

2020–present: Tenet and Oppenheimer
Nolan's next film was the science fiction film Tenet (2020), described by Tom Shone of The Sunday Times as "a globe-spinning riff on all things Nolanesque".[155] Nolan had worked on the screenplay for more than five years after deliberating about its central ideas for over a decade.[156] Delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenet was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theatres after the pandemic shutdown.[157] The film tells the story of an unnamed protagonist (played by John David Washington) who travels through time to stop a world-threatening attack.[158] It grossed $363 million worldwide on a production budget of $200 million, becoming Nolan's first to underperform at the box-office.[159] Tenet was described as his most polarising film; critics praised the ambition and technical aspects but found its story confusing.[160][151] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five out of five, calling it "a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility—but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination".[161] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter described it as "a chilly, cerebral film—easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity".[162] At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Production Design.[163] Following the release of Tenet, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.[164] He served as an executive producer on Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021), a director's cut of 2017's Justice League.[165]


Nolan at BFI Southbank in 2024
Nolan's 12th film was Oppenheimer (2023), a biopic based on J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atom bomb.[166] It was Nolan's first R-rated film since Insomnia (2002).[167] The film was financed and distributed by Universal Pictures, making it Nolan's first since Memento that was not made for Warner Bros. He disagreed with Warner Bros.' decision to simultaneously release their films in theatres and on HBO Max.[168] Nolan secured the deal with Universal after he was promised a production budget of around $100 million with an equal marketing budget, total creative control, 20 per cent of first-dollar gross, a 100-day theatrical window and a blackout period from the studio wherein the company would not release another film three weeks before or after Oppenheimer's release.[169] The film received critical acclaim.[170] Matthew Jackson of The A.V. Club wrote, "Oppenheimer deserves the title of masterpiece. It's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain."[171] Terming it "boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet", BBC Culture's Caryn James added that it combined the "explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy" with the "cerebral underpinnings" of Memento, Inception and Tenet.[172] Oppenheimer grossed over $960 million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2023.[173] Among the film's numerous accolades,[174][175] Nolan won the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.[176]

Personal life and public image
Christopher Nolan, on the right, is looking directly towards the camera as Emma Thomas is looking to her right.
Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas in January 2011
Nolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19.[11][19] She has worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997.[46][177] The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles.[178]

Nolan prefers to maintain a certain level of mystery about his work.[179] Refusing to discuss his personal life,[180] he feels that too much biographical information about a filmmaker detracts from the experience of his audiences. "I actually don't want people to have me in mind at all when they're watching the films."[179]

Filmmaking style
Main article: Cinematic style of Christopher Nolan
Nolan's films are largely centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and personal identity.[181][182] His work is characterised by mathematically inspired ideas and images, unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and sound.[d] Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan "an emotional mathematician".[187] BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz described him as "an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning".[188] Joseph Bevan wrote, "His films allow arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot conceits."[104] Nolan views himself as "an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system".[189]

"Christopher Nolan doesn't make sense. And that is exactly how he likes it. In twenty-three years and through twelve films, he has defied the laws of Hollywood by creating startling, original genre pieces that have revelled in their own complexity, confounding every maxim by which the studios hope to appeal to the widest audience. And yet he does that too. Cinemas fill on the possibility of the next Nolan film. Whatever form it might take."

—Film author Ian Nathan on Nolan as a filmmaker (2022)[190]

In the sixteen-essay book The Philosophy of Christopher Nolan, professional philosophers and writers analysed Nolan's work; they identified themes of self-destruction, the nature and value of the truth, and the political mindset of the hero and villain, among others.[191] Robbie B. H. Goh, a professor of English literature, described Nolan as a "philosophical filmmaker" who includes philosophical ideas—existentialism, morality, epistemology and the distinction between appearance and reality—in films that frequently portray suspense, action and violence. Goh appreciated his ability to incorporate such themes in films that possess "elements of the Hollywood blockbuster"—which help keep the audiences engaged—but simultaneously remain "more thoughtful and self-reflexive than the typical consumerist action film".[192] He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect "a heterogeneity of conditions of products" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, "a wide range of genres and settings" and "a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility".[193]

David Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his "experimental impulses" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as "experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting".[194] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan "kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become "a largely computer-generated art form".[196] Because of Nolan's deep involvement in the technical facet of his films, Stuart Joy described him as a "complete filmmaker", who "oversees all aspects of production while also managing cultural and industrial factors outside of the text".[197]

Recognition
Nolan has made some of the most influential and popular films of his time.[e] Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades,[45][202][203] and according to The Wall Street Journal, his "ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry".[204] His films have earned more than $6 billion.[205] Nolan's films Memento and The Dark Knight have been selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant.[206][207] These films and Inception appeared in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and The Hollywood Reporter's poll of best films ever made.[208][209] In 2017, The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar featured in Empire magazine's poll of "The 100 Greatest Movies".[210] In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter listed Nolan as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment and described him as a "franchise unto himself".[211] Parade ranked Nolan number eight in its 2022 list of 75 Best Movie Directors of All Time.[212]

Two of Nolan's films (Memento and The Dark Knight) have been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.[206][207]
Nolan's work has been as "intensely embraced, analysed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics".[180][213] Calling him "a persuasively inventive storyteller", Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute named Nolan one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. Andrew wrote that Nolan's films are "not so much [notable] for their considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair as for their brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions".[214] David Bordwell observed that Nolan is "considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers", citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim and popularity among cinemagoers.[194][215] In 2008, Philip French deemed Nolan "the first major talent to emerge this century".[216] Mark Kermode complimented Nolan for bringing "the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking and apply[ing] them to Hollywood blockbusters. He's living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable".[217] The Observer's Ryan Gilbey described Nolan as a "skillful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais".[218] Mark Cousins applauded Nolan for embracing big ideas, "Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas—but not Christopher Nolan".[219] Scott Foundas of Variety declared Nolan "the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation",[220] and Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called him "the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae".[221]

Nolan has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and his work has influenced them.[222][223][224] Kenneth Branagh called Nolan's approach to large-scale filmmaking "unique in modern cinema", adding, "regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. I think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera."[225] Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his "singular vision" and credited with "invent[ing] the post-heroic superhero".[226] Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, "People talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work."[227] Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating "beautifully made films on a big scale".[228]

Damien Chazelle lauded Nolan for his ability "to make the most seemingly impersonal projects—superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders—feel deeply personal".[229] Discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's Dark Knight series as an example of both;[230] he has described Memento and Inception as "masterworks".[231] Denis Villeneuve was impressed by Nolan's ability "to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope ... To bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now—it's very rare. Every movie that he comes out with, I have more admiration for his work."[232] James Cameron expressed disappointment that Nolan was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director for Inception, calling it "the most astounding piece of film creation and direction of the year, hands down".[231]

Nolan has been nominated for eight Academy Awards (winning two), eight British Academy Film Awards (winning two) and six Golden Globe Awards (winning one).[43][233][234][235] Nolan was named an Honorary Fellow of UCL in 2006,[236] and conferred an honorary doctorate in literature in 2017.[237] From 2011 to 2014, he appeared in Forbes Celebrity 100 list based on his income and popularity.[238] In 2012, he became the youngest director to receive a hand-and-footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[239] Nolan appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.[240] He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to film.[241] In 2023, he was awarded the Federation of American Scientists' Public Service Award for his depiction of scientists in his film Oppenheimer.[242] In 2024, Nolan received the British Film Institute Fellowship in recognition of his "extraordinary achievements and enormous contribution to cinema,"[243] and the Honorary César award from the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma for "continually push[ing] the boundaries of storytelling."[244]

Notes
 Nolan has continued his collaboration with the Belic brothers, receiving a credit for his editorial assistance on their Oscar-nominated documentary Genghis Blues (1999).[13]
 The name of the company is derived from syncope, a medical term for fainting. Sorcha Ní Fhlainn, a lecturer specialising in film studies, alluded this wordplay to Nolan's style of "disorientation" in his work. She also associated the name with synthetic and philosopher Jean Baudrillard's treatise Simulacra and Simulation.[47]

Citizenship Act, 1955
Status: In force
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) was passed by the Parliament of India on 11 December 2019. It amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 by providing an accelerated pathway to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who arrived in India by 2014. The eligible minorities were stated as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians.[3][4] The law does not grant such eligibility to Muslims from these countries.[5][6][7] The act was the first time that religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law, and it attracted global criticism.[7][a][b][c]

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the Indian government,[8] had promised in previous election manifestos to offer Indian citizenship to members of persecuted religious minorities who had migrated from neighbouring countries.[9][10] Under the 2019 amendment, migrants who had entered India by 31 December 2014, and had suffered "religious persecution or fear of religious persecution" in their country of origin, were made eligible for accelerated citizenship.[4] The amendment relaxed the residence requirement for naturalisation of these migrants from twelve years to six.[11] According to Intelligence Bureau records, there will be just over 30,000 immediate beneficiaries of the act.[12][d]

The amendment has been criticized as discriminating on the basis of religion, particularly for excluding Muslims.[5][6] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called it "fundamentally discriminatory", adding that while India's "goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome", this should be accomplished through a non-discriminatory "robust national asylum system".[16] Critics express concerns that the bill would be used, along with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), to render many Muslim citizens stateless, as they may be unable to meet stringent birth or identity proof requirements.[17][18] Commentators also question the exclusion of persecuted religious minorities from other regions such as Tibet, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.[17][19] The Indian government said that since Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh have Islam as their state religion, it is therefore "unlikely" that Muslims would "face religious persecution" there.[10][20] However, certain Muslim groups, such as Hazaras (mostly Shias) and Ahmadis, have historically faced persecution in these countries.[21][22][23]

The passage of the legislation caused large-scale protests in India.[24] Assam and other northeastern states witnessed violent demonstrations against the bill over fears that granting Indian citizenship to refugees and immigrants will cause a loss of their "political rights, culture and land rights" and motivate further migration from Bangladesh.[25][26][27] In other parts of India, protesters said that the bill discriminated against Muslims, and demanded that Indian citizenship be granted to Muslim refugees and immigrants as well.[28] Major protests against the Act were held at some universities in India. Students at Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia alleged brutal suppression by the police.[29] The protests have led to the deaths of several protesters, injuries to both protesters and police officers, damage to public and private property, the detention of hundreds of people, and suspensions of local internet mobile phone connectivity in certain areas.[30][31] Some states announced that they would not implement the Act. In response, the Union Home Ministry said that states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of the CAA.[32]

On 11 March 2024, the Ministry of Home Affairs officially announced the rules for the Citizenship Amendment Act. This development follows Union Home Minister Amit Shah's commitment to implement them before the 2024 national elections.[33]

Background
Citizenship law
The Indian Constitution implemented in 1950 guaranteed citizenship to all of the country's residents at the commencement of the constitution, and made no distinction on the basis of religion.[34][35][36] In 1955, the Indian government passed the Citizenship Act, by which all people born in India subject to some limitations were accorded citizenship. The Act also provided two means for foreigners to acquire Indian citizenship. People from "undivided India"[e] were given a means of registration after seven years of residency in India. Those from other countries were given a means of naturalisation after twelve years of residency in India.[38][39] Political developments in the 1980s, particularly those related to the violent Assam movement against migrants from Bangladesh, triggered revisions to the Citizenship Act.[40][41][42] The Act was first amended in 1985 after the Assam Accord signed by Rajiv Gandhi government, granting citizenship to all Bangladeshi migrants that arrived before 1971 subject to some provisos. The government also agreed to identify all migrants that arrived afterwards, remove their names from the electoral rolls, and expel them from the country.[43][44][42][45]

The Citizenship Act was further amended in 1992, 2003, 2005 and 2015. In December 2003, the National Democratic Alliance government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 with far-reaching revisions of the Citizenship Act. It added the notion of "illegal immigrants" to the Act, making them ineligible to apply for citizenship (by registration or naturalisation), and declaring their children also as illegal immigrants.[46][47] Illegal immigrants were defined as citizens of other countries who entered India without valid travel documents, or who remained in the country beyond the period permitted by their travel documents.[48] They can be deported or imprisoned.[49]

The 2003 amendment also mandated the Government of India to create and maintain a National Register of Citizens. The bill was supported by the Indian National Congress, as well as the Left parties, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI (M)).[50][51][f] During the parliamentary debate on the amendment, the leader of opposition, Manmohan Singh, stated that refugees belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and other countries had faced persecution, and requested a liberal approach to granting them citizenship.[53][54][55] According to M.K. Venu, the formulation of the 2003 amendment discussed by Advani and Singh was based on the idea that Muslim groups in Pakistan and Afghanistan that had experienced persecution also needed to be treated with compassion.[55]

Immigrants and refugees
A very large number of illegal immigrants, the largest numbers of whom are from Bangladesh, live in India. The Task Force on Border Management quoted the figure of 15 million illegal migrants in 2001. In 2004, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government stated in Parliament that there were 12 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants in India.[56] The reasons for the scale of migration include a porous border, historical migration patterns, economic reasons, and cultural and linguistic ties.[57] Many illegal migrants from Bangladesh had eventually received the right to vote. According to Niraja Jayal, this enfranchisement was widely described as an attempt to win elections using the votes of the illegal migrants from Bangladesh.[43][58] Bangladeshi scholar Abul Barkat estimated that over 11 million Hindus have left Bangladesh for India between 1964 and 2013, at a rate of 230,612 annually.[59][60] The reasons were religious persecution and discrimination, especially at the hands of the post-independence military regimes.[60][61][62] An unknown number of Pakistani Hindu refugees also live in India. An estimated 5,000 refugees arrive per year, citing religious persecution and forced conversion.[63][64][65]

India is not a signatory to either the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol.[66][67] It does not have a national policy on refugees. All refugees are classed as "illegal migrants". While India has been willing to host refugees, its traditional position formulated by Jawaharlal Nehru is that such refugees must return to their home countries after the situation returns to normal.[68][69] According to the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, India hosts refugees in excess of 456,000,[70] with about 200,000 from "non-neighbouring" countries hosted via the UNHCR.[68][71][g] According to Shuvro Sarker, since the 1950s and particularly since the 1990s, the Indian governments under various political parties have studied and drafted laws for the naturalisation of refugees and asylum seekers. These drafts have struggled with issues relating to a mass influx of refugees, urban planning, cost of basic services, the obligations to protected tribes, and the impact on pre-existing regional poverty levels within India.[73]

Bharatiya Janata Party activities
The "detection, deletion and deportation" of illegal migrants has been on the agenda of the BJP since 1996.[74] In the 2016 assembly elections for the border state of Assam, the BJP leaders campaigned in the state promising voters that they would rid Assam of the Bangladeshis. Simultaneously, they also promised to protect Hindus who had fled religious persecution in Bangladesh.[75] According to commentators, in the context of an effort to identify and deport illegal immigrants, the proposal to grant citizenship took a new meaning. Illegal migrants could be granted citizenship if they were non-Muslim, on the grounds that they were refugees; only Muslims would be deported.[35]

In its manifesto for the 2014 Indian general election, the BJP promised to provide a "natural home" for persecuted Hindu refugees.[76] The year before the 2016 elections in Assam, the government legalised refugees belonging to religious minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh, granting them long-term visas. Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals belonging to "minority communities" were exempted from the requirements of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946.[77] Specifically mentioned were "Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis and Buddhists," who had been "compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution". Eligibility for the exemption was made contingent on a migrant having arrived in India by 31 December 2014.[78]

The BJP government introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[79][80] The bill stalled in parliament following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India. Opponents of the bill in Assam and the northeastern states of India stated that any migration from Bangladesh "irrespective of religion" would cause "loss of political rights and culture of the indigenous people".[80][81] According to Niraja Jayal, while the BJP had promised to grant Indian citizenship to all Hindu migrants from Bangladesh in its election campaigns during the 2010s, the draft Amendment bill angered many in Assam, including its own political allies because they viewed the amendment as a violation of the Assam Accord.[82] That accord promised to identify and deport all illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered the state after 1971, "regardless of their religious identity".[82] In 2018, as the draft of this Amendment was being discussed, numerous Assamese organisations petitioned and agitated against it. They fear that the Amendment will encourage more migration and diminish employment opportunities to the native residents in the state.[82]

In parallel to the drafting of an amendment to the 1955 Citizenship Act, the BJP government completed an effort to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam. The process for creating the NRC had been put in place by the Citizenship rules enacted in 2003, and had been implemented in Assam under Supreme Court supervision as a result of a 2014 Supreme Court ruling.[83] This was mandated under prior peace agreements in northeast, and the Assam Accord in particular.[84][85] The updated register was made public in August 2019; approximately 1.9 million residents were not on the list, and were in danger of losing their citizenship.[86] Many of those affected were Bengali Hindus, who constitute a major voter base for the BJP; according to commentators, the BJP withdrew its support for the Assam NRC towards its end for this reason.[87][88][h] On 19 November 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah, declared in the Rajya Sabha (the Upper House of the Indian parliament) that the National Register of Citizens would be implemented throughout the country.[91]

Legislative history
The BJP government first introduced a bill to amend the citizenship law in 2016, which would have made non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh eligible for Indian citizenship.[79][80] Although this bill was passed by the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian parliament, it stalled in the Rajya Sabha, following widespread political opposition and protests in northeast India.[80][81]

The BJP reiterated its commitment to amend the citizenship act in its 2019 election campaign. It stated that religious minorities such as Hindus and Sikhs are persecuted in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries, and promised to fast track a path to citizenship for non-Muslim refugees.[92][93] After the elections, the BJP government drafted a bill that addressed the concerns of its northeastern states. It excluded Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur, except for non-tribal cities exempted under pre-existing regulations. It also excluded tribal areas of Assam.[94] The Indian government, while proposing an Amendment, said, that its bill aims to grant quicker access to citizenship to those who have fled religious persecution in neighbouring countries and have taken refuge in India.[20][95][5]

The Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 as the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016. It was referred to the Joint parliamentary committee on 12 August 2016. The Committee submitted its report on 7 January 2019 to Parliament. The Bill was taken into consideration and passed by Lok Sabha on 8 January 2019. It was pending for consideration and passing by the Rajya Sabha. Consequent to dissolution of 16th Lok Sabha, this Bill has lapsed.[96]

After the formation of 17th Lok Sabha, the Union Cabinet cleared the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, on 4 December 2019 for introduction in the parliament.[80][97] The Bill was introduced in 17th Lok Sabha by the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah on 9 December 2019 and was passed on the midnight of 10 December 2019 despite attempts by the opposition to filibuster the bill,[98] with 311 MPs voting in favour and 80 against it.[99][100][101]

The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 11 December 2019 with 125 votes in favour and 105 votes against it.[102][103] The parties that voted in favour in spite of not being in the ruling coalition included JD(U), AIADMK, BJD, TDP and YSRCP.[102][103]

After receiving assent from the President of India on 12 December 2019, the bill assumed the status of an act.[104] The act came into force on 10 January 2020.[1][105] The implementation of the CAA began on 20 December 2019, when Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya gave citizenship certificates to seven refugees from Pakistan.[106]

The Amendments
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, by inserting the following provisos in section 2, sub-section (1), after clause (b):[105]

Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;[105]

A new section 6B was inserted (in the section concerning naturalisation), with four clauses, the first of which stated:

(1) The Central Government or an authority specified by it in this behalf may, subject to such conditions, restrictions and manner as may be prescribed, on an application made in this behalf, grant a certificate of registration or certificate of naturalisation to a person referred to in the proviso to clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 2.[105]

The "exempted" classes of persons were previously defined in the Foreigners (Amendment) Order, 2015 (issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946):[78]

3A. Exemption of certain class of foreigners. – (1) Persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution and entered into India on or before 31 December 2014

(a) without valid documents including passport or other travel documents and who have been exempted under rule 4 from the provisions of rule 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules, 1950 [...]; or
(b) with valid documents including passport or other travel document and the validity of any of such documents has expired,
are hereby granted exemption from the application of provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the orders made thereunder in respect of their stay in India without such documents or after the expiry of those documents, as the case may be [...].[78]

The Rules had been further amended in 2016 by adding Afghanistan to the list of countries.[107]

Exemptions were granted to northeastern regions of India in the clause (4) of section 6B:

(4) Nothing in this section shall apply to tribal area of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram or Tripura as included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and the area covered under "The Inner Line" notified under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873.[105]

Analysis
The Act has amended the Citizenship Act, 1955 to give eligibility for Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and who entered India on or before 31 December 2014. The Act does not mention Muslims.[108][109] According to Intelligence Bureau records, the immediate beneficiaries of the Amended Act will be 31,313 people, which include 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis.[15][110]

Under the act, one of the requirements for citizenship by naturalisation is that the applicant must have lived in India during the last 12 months, and for 11 of the previous 14 years. The bill relaxes this 11-year requirement to 5 years for persons belonging to the same six religions and three countries. The bill exempts the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura from its applicability. It also exempts the areas regulated through the Inner Line Permit, which include Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.[111][112][113] The inclusion of Manipur in Inner Line Permit was also announced on 9 December 2019.[94]

The bill includes a new provision for cancellation of the registration of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) if there are any violations of any law of India, whether they are petty infractions or heinous felonies, however it also adds the opportunity for the OCI holder to be heard before the verdict.[105][80]

Exclusion of persecuted Muslims
Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are not offered eligibility for citizenship under the new Act.[5][6][114] Critics have questioned the exclusion on account of anti-Islamic sentiment. The amendment limits itself to the Muslim-majority neighbours of India and takes no cognisance of the Muslims of those countries.[72] Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh are Muslim-majority countries that have modified their constitutions in recent decades to declare Islam their official state religion. Therefore, according to the Indian government, Muslims in these Islamic countries are "unlikely to face religious persecution". The government says that Muslims cannot be "treated as persecuted minorities" in these Muslim-majority countries.[20][10] The BBC says that while these countries have provisions in their constitution guaranteeing non-Muslims rights, including the freedom to practice their religion, in practice non-Muslim populations have experienced discrimination and persecution.[20]

The Economist criticised the exclusion by arguing that, the Indian government concern or religious persecution should have been extended to Ahmadiyyas – a Muslim sect who have been "viciously hounded in Pakistan as heretics", and the Hazaras – another Muslim sect who have been murdered by the Taliban in Afghanistan. They should be treated as minorities.[21]

Exclusion of other persecuted communities
The Act does not include migrants from non-Muslim countries fleeing persecution to India, including Hindu refugees from Sri Lanka and Buddhist refugees from Tibet.

The Act does not mention Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamils were allowed to settle as refugees in Tamil Nadu in 1980s and 1990s due to systemic violence from the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka. They include 29,500 "hill country Tamils" (Malaiha).[69][115]

The Act does not provide relief to Tibetan Buddhist refugees,[17] who came to India in the 1950s and 1960s due to the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Their status has been of refugees over the decades. According to a 1992 UNHCR report, the then Indian government stated that they remain refugees and do not have the right to acquire Indian nationality.[116]

The Act does not address Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar. The Indian government has been deporting Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[22][117]

Relationship to NRC
The National Register of Citizens is a registry of all legal citizens, whose construction and maintenance was mandated by the 2003 amendment of the Citizenship Act. As of January 2020, it has only been implemented for the state of Assam, but the BJP has promised its implementation for the whole of India in its 2019 election manifesto.[118] The NRC documents all the legal citizens so that the people who are left out can be recognized as illegal immigrants (often called "foreigners"). The experience with Assam NRC shows that many people were declared "foreigners" because their documents were deemed insufficient.[119]

In this context, there are concerns that the present amendment of the Citizenship Act provides a "shield" to the non-Muslims, who can claim that they were migrants who fled persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Bangladesh, while the Muslims do not have such a benefit.[120][121][122][123] Such a claim may be possible only for people in the border states who have some ethnic resemblance to the people of Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, but not to the people of interior states.[18][124] Muslim leaders have interpreted the CAA–NRC package in precisely these terms, viz., that the Muslims in the country would be targeted (by considering documents as insufficient) as potential foreigners, leaving out all non-Muslims.[18]

In an interview to India Today, Home Minister Amit Shah offered reassurance that no Indian citizen needs to worry. "We will make special provisions to ensure that no Indian citizen from minority communities is victimised in the NRC process." But the Indian Express said that the purpose of the NRC is precisely to identify the Indian citizens. So these references to "Indian citizens" remain unexplained.[18]

Main article: Citizenship Amendment Act protests
The passage of the Act triggered different types of protests and criticisms. Violent protests erupted in Assam, where the protesters maintained that the new provisions of this Act are against prior agreements such as the Assam Accord,[25][26] and that they would cause a "loss of political rights and culture". The India-Japan summit in Guwahati, which was supposed to be attended by Shinzō Abe was cancelled.[125][126] The UK, USA, France, Israel and Canada issued travel warnings for people visiting India's north-east region, telling their citizens to "exercise caution".[127][128][129]

In other parts of India, political and student activists protested that the law "marginalizes Muslims, is prejudicial against Muslims" and sought that Muslim migrants and refugees should also be granted Indian citizenship per its secular foundations.[27] The protesters demanded that the law should grant Indian citizenship to Muslim immigrants and refugees too.[28]

Protests against the bill were held in several metropolitan cities across India, including Kolkata,[127] Delhi,[130][131] Mumbai,[102] Bengaluru,[132] Hyderabad,[133] and Jaipur.[130] Rallies were also held in various Indian states of West Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Bihar, Maharastra, Kerala and Karnataka.[127] 27 people were killed by police firing guns in the whole of India.[134][135] Along with in-person protests, the internet—especially on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter—was also the site of comment and debate regarding the constitutionality of the amendment. Large metropolitan areas (with Kolkata, Mumbai, and Bangalore standing out) became hotspots for online posts about the CAA.[136] As with in-person protests, so also online opposition to the BJP and statements opposing Islamophobia came from people of all backgrounds and experiences.[136] Overall, protesters framed the CAA as a continuation of a history of anti-Islamic legislation and propaganda by the BJP.[citation needed]

Various cities around the world, including New York, Washington D. C.,[137] Melbourne,[138][139] Paris, Berlin,[140] Geneva, Barcelona, San Francisco, Tokyo, Helsinki,[141] and Amsterdam, witnessed protests against the Act and the police brutality faced by Indian protesters.[142][143] This showed up especially in the United States, Middle East, and Europe on social media; for example, 13% of Twitter flow on the CAA came from these international locations. The bulk of the in-person and social media protest, however, was in India.[136]

Students from various universities like Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University, Nadwa College, Jawaharlal Nehru University, IIT Kanpur, IIT Madras, Jadavpur University, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, IISc, Pondicherry University, and IIM Ahmedabad also held protest. More than 25 student associations from all over India joined protest. On 15 December, police forcefully entered the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia university, where protests were being held, and detained the students. Police used batons and tear gas on the students. More than a hundred students were injured and an equal number were detained. The police action was widely criticized, and resulted in protests across the country.[144][145][146]

Muslims all over India came out to protest the CAA–NRC package with a renewed assertion of their identity as Indians.[147] Muslim women started protest at Shaheen Bagh on 15 December 2019 start as an ongoing 24/7 sit-in peaceful protest.[148][149][150] The protesters at Shaheen Bagh have blocked a major highway[i] in New Delhi using non-violent resistance for more than 51 days now as of 5 February 2020.[151] On 24 February, violent clashes occurred during the North East Delhi riots in which seven people where killed and more than a hundred injured.[152] The death toll rose to 42 within 36 hours, with 250 people getting injured.[153]

Comparison with Nazi Laws
In February 2023, Chicago based human rights organization Justice For All released a report titled 'The Nazification Of India' which compared the Citizenship Amendment Act to the Reich citizenship law which redefined German citizenship to exclude people of "non-German blood."[154]

Indian government response
On 16 December, after the protests entered the fifth day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for calm in a series of tweets saying "No Indian has anything to worry regarding this act. This act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India".[155][156][non-primary source needed] As CAA protests raised concerns on combined effects of CAA with NRC, both the PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah stating that there has been no talk on pan-Indian NRC in their government for now, and neither the cabinet nor the legal department has discussed it.[157][18]

Considering Violence and damage to public properties during demonstration, on 19 December, police banned protests in several parts of India with the imposition of section 144 which prohibits the gathering of more than 4 individuals in a public space as being unlawful, namely, parts of the capital Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka, including Bangalore. Police in Chennai denied permission for marches, rallies or any other demonstration.[158][159] Internet services were shut down in several parts of Delhi. As a result of defining the ban, thousands of protesters were detained, including several opposition leaders and activists such as Ramachandra Guha, Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sandeep Dikshit, Tehseen Poonawalla and D Raja.[160][161][162]

Rallies in support
See also: Citizenship Amendment Act protests § Pro-CAA demonstrations
Right-wing student groups such as those from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad – a student wing of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, held rallies in support of the amended Citizenship Act.[163][164] Rallies in support of the Amendment Act were led by BJP leaders in West Bengal, who alleged that the state government blocked them. They also accused the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party members of misinforming the state's residents about the new law.[165] Similarly, some 15,000 people joined a BJP-organised rally in support of the Act in Rajasthan.[166] On 20 December 2019, scores of people held demonstrations in Central Park, Connaught Place, New Delhi in support of the Act.[167][168] Hundreds of people gathered in Pune, forming a human chain, in support of CAA, on 22 December.[169][170] ABVP members held a rally in support of CAA and NRC in Kerala.[171] Hundreds of citizens were out on the streets in support of the citizenship law in Bangalore.[172] Jay Kholiya, ex-Member and Officer Bearer of ABVP Maharashtra had resigned from his office during these protests citing "Ideological Differences".[173] In Assam, ABVP's National Executive Moon Talukdar also had joined Anti-CAA Protests. He also announced that around 800 members would resign in opposition to the government's move to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).[174]

Refugees
Hindu refugee families in Assam, living since the 1960s in a refugee camp and who had been denied Indian citizenship so far, said that the Amendment had "kindled hope" at first. They added that the recent protests against the Act and demands for its cancellation have made them fearful of the future.[175] In New Delhi, about 600 refugees from Pakistan living in a camp consisting of tiny shanties celebrated the new law.[176] A delegation of Sikh refugees who had arrived from Afghanistan three decades ago thanked the Indian government for amending the citizenship law. They stated the Amended law would allow them to finally gain Indian citizenship and "join the mainstream".[177]

Some Rohingya Muslim refugees in India were not optimistic about the Amendment and feared they would be deported.[178][179] Other Rohingya refugees expressed gratitude at having been allowed to stay in India, but did not make any comments specific to the Act lest they provoke a backlash. They said that local police had asked them not to protest against the Act.[180]

More than 200 families have arrived in the Indian state of Punjab with all their belongings after the law was enacted.[181]

Political and legal challenge
The bill was opposed by the Indian National Congress, who said it would create communal tensions and polarise India.[182] The Chief Ministers of the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Kerala and Rajasthan and union territory of Puducherry – all led by non-BJP governments – said they will not implement the law.[183][184][127] According to the Union Home Ministry, states lack the legal power to stop the implementation of CAA. The Ministry stated that "the new legislation has been enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. The states have no power to reject it".[32] Modi stated on 21 December that the NRC had only been implemented in Assam to follow a directive from the Supreme Court of India, and that there had been no decision taken to implement it nation-wide.[185]

Kerala becomes the first state to challenge the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) by filing a plea in the Supreme Court of India under Article 131 of the Constitution.[186] Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan affirmed that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is viewed as divisive and declared its non-implementation in the state, asserting that it treats Muslim minorities unfairly. He stated, "All of Kerala will stand united in opposing this communally divisive law."[187][188]

The Indian Union Muslim League petitioned the Supreme Court of India to declare the bill illegal.[189][190][191] The first hearing by the Supreme Court of India on 60 petitions challenging the Act was on 18 December 2019. During the first hearing, the court declined to stay implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.[189] On 22 January 2020, around 143 petitions, including several petitions filed after 18 December 2019 were heard. The court again declined the request for stay.[192][193] The next hearing was scheduled on 21 April 2020.[193]

Commentary and petitions
The foreign intelligence agency of India, R&AW, had expressed concern while deposing in front of the joint parliamentary committee, and had stated that the bill could be used by agents of the foreign intelligence agencies to infiltrate legally into India.[194] Former National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon called the incident a self inflicted goal that has isolated India from the International community.[195]

Harish Salve, former Solicitor General of India, said that the bill does not violate Article 14, Article 25 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India.[196]

A group of prominent individuals and organisations from around 12 countries representing minorities of Bangladesh released a joint statement in which they described the Act as "humanitarian" provision through which India has "partially fulfilled" its obligations towards the minorities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.[197] The National Sikh Front – a group representing the Sikhs in Jammu and Kashmir, stated that it supports the Act because it will help the Sikh refugees in India who left Afghanistan.[198]

A petition opposing the bill was signed by more 1,000 Indian scientists and scholars.[199] The petition stated that "The use of religion as a criterion for citizenship in the proposed bill" was "inconsistent with the basic structure of the Constitution".[199] A similar number of Indian academicians and intellectuals released a statement in support of the legislation.[200] The petition stated that the act "fulfills the long-standing demand of providing refuge to persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan".[201]

Historian Neeti Nair commented that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens represent steps towards a "Hindu Rashtra" that should be "summarily dismissed both by the people and by the courts".[202] Similar views were also expressed by social activists such as Harsh Mander,[203] Indira Jaising.[204] and media houses National Herald and The Caravan.[205][206] The Japan Times termed the Act as "Modi's project to make a Hindu India".[207]

International reactions
 Afghanistan: Former Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai urged Government of India to treat all minorities equally. In an interview to The Hindu, he said, "We don't have persecuted minorities in Afghanistan." Mentioning the Afghanistan conflict, he said, "The whole country is persecuted. We have been in war and conflict for a long time. All religions in Afghanistan, Muslims and Hindus and Sikhs, which are our three main religions, have suffered."[208]
 Australia: Australian Greens MP David Shoebridge tabled motion in the New South Wales Legislative Council, calling for serious attention to India's CAA, the Modi government's reaction to the democratic protests and to renegotiate trade agreements between Australia and India so that they include a human rights clause.[209]
 Bahrain: The Shura Council (the Council of Representatives) called on the Government of India to refrain from implementing the Act, taking the rights of the Muslims into account, and respecting the international principles.[210]
 Bangladesh: Bangladesh's Minister of Foreign Affairs, A. K. Abdul Momen said that this bill could weaken India's historic character as a secular nation and denied that minorities were facing religious persecution in his country.[211] In an interview to Gulf News, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, "Within India, people are facing many problems" and expressed her concerns saying, "We don't understand why (the Indian government) did it. It was not necessary". However, she maintained her stance that the CAA and NRC are internal matters of India. She also said that Prime Minister Modi assured her of no reverse migration from India.[212]
 France: Ambassador of France to India, Emmanuel Lenain, said that France considers the legislation an internal matter of India and respects it.[213]
 Kuwait: Around 27 lawmakers in Kuwait expressed "deep concern" over "the abusive legislative and repressive security measures taken by the Indian government against Muslims". They asked the Kuwait Government to ‘exert diplomatic efforts’ and to approach the UN to address the situation.[214]
 Malaysia: The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, criticised the law and said it could "deprive some Muslims of their citizenship". India rejected the criticism and said the law does not "deprive any Indian of any faith of her or his citizenship".[215]
 Maldives: Maldives' Parliament Speaker and former president, Mohamed Nasheed, said that CAA is an internal issue of India and was democratically passed through both the houses of the Parliament.[216]
 Pakistan: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan criticised the Act.[217] Pakistan's National Assembly passed a resolution labelling the Act as a "discriminatory law" and argued that it contravened "bilateral agreements and understandings between India and Pakistan, particularly those on security and rights of minorities in the respective countries".[218] This act was denounced by both the Hindu and Sikh communities of Pakistan. In particular, it was rejected by the Pakistan Hindu Council, a representative body of Hindus in the country. Many lawmakers were vocal in voicing their protest over this legislation. These included Lal Chand Malhi, member of the national assembly from Pakistan's ruling party Tehreek-e-Insaf, and Sachanand Lakhwani, member of the provincial assembly of Sindh.[219]
 Russia: Deputy Russian Ambassador to India, Roman Babushkin, said that Russia considers the legislation an internal matter of India.[220]
 Sri Lanka: Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa termed the CAA as an internal matter of India. While answering a question about the non-inclusion of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, he said, "Sri Lankans can return anytime they want. Their houses are there. They can come back anytime they want. We have no objection. Recently, around 4,000 of them returned. It all depends on what they want."[221]
 United Kingdom: The outgoing British High Commissioner to India, Dominic Asquith, said that the UK expressed hope that the Indian government will address concerns of the people as its manifesto commitment is "sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishvas" (with all, development for all, and trust of all)[222]
 United States: The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) called for sanctions[223] against Amit Shah and "other principal leadership" over passage of the Bill.[224][j] India's Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement in response, stating that the statement made by the USCIRF was "neither accurate nor warranted", and that neither the CAA nor the NRC sought to strip Indian citizens of citizenship.[226][227][228] The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs questioned the intent of the Bill and noted that "[a]ny religious test for citizenship undermines this most basic democratic tenet."[229] On 19 December, however, the United States Secretary of State said that the US respects Indian democracy since it has a "robust" internal debate on the Citizenship Act.[230] The President of the United States, Donald Trump, during his visit to India, declined to comment on the CAA and said that "it is up to India."[231]
Two city councils, in Seattle and Cambridge, passed resolutions asking India to repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act.[232]
Organisations
 European Union: Ambassador of the European Union to India, Ugo Astuto, said that he trusts that the outcome of the CAA discussion would be in line with the high standards set by the Indian constitution.[233]
 Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: OIC expressed their concern about present situation of CAA-NRC and urged the Government of India to ensure the safety of the Muslim minority and to follow the obligations outlined in the Charter of the United Nations.[234]
 United Nations: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights criticised the Act and called it "fundamentally discriminatory in nature". It added, "Although India's broader naturalization laws remain in place, these amendments will have a discriminatory effect on people’s access to nationality."[235]
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights filed an intervention in the Supreme Court of India on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in 2020.[236]
Implementation
Government of India released the details and rules about the implementation of the act in Gazette of India on 11 March 2024. An online portal was also opened to let the eligible refugees apply for the citizenship.[237] Politically it was significant because it was released just before the 2024 Indian general election, and was esteemed to be an electoral gain for the BJP in the upcoming election.[238] Opposition parties criticised the timing of the notification, accusing BJP for delaying four years to implement it just to use it as a political issue in the election.[239]

Notes
 Sharma (2019), p. 523: "First, citizenship status biased towards religious identity is by no means a new idea.... A careful study of the policies and laws related to citizenship, adopted since independence substantiate the assertion that citizenship in India has always been based on an implicit belief that India is for Hindus."
 Sen (2018), pp. 10–11: "Nehru’s response [to Patel's warning] made it clear that Muslim migrants from Pakistan could not join the ranks of refugees in India... Thus, despite broad public statements promising citizenship to all displaced persons from Pakistan, Hindu migrants alone counted as citizen-refugees in post-partition India."
 Jayal (2019), pp. 34–35: "While some elements of religious difference had... been covertly smuggled in earlier, this bill seeks to do so overtly."
 According to the Indian Intelligence Bureau figures given to the Joint Parliamentary Committee, 31,313 people were granted long-term visas using the criteria mentioned in the Act. They included 25,447 Hindus, 5,807 Sikhs, 55 Christians, 2 Buddhists and 2 Parsis. They were expected to be the immediate beneficiaries of the Act.[13][14][15]
 The Act defines "undivided India" as "India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935, as originally enacted".[37] It included, in addition to India, the present day Pakistan and Bangladesh.
 In 2012, the then CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat had written to Manmohan Singh, who was prime minister at the time, reminding him of his 2003 statement and urging him to make a suitable amendment in policy to allow "minority community refugees" easy citizenship.[52]
 Indian government statistics in 2014 show 289,394 "stateless persons" in India. The majority were from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (about 100,000 each), followed by those from Tibet, Myanmar, Pakistan and Afghanistan.[72]
 The excluded people of the Assam NRC were 0.5 million Bengali Hindus and 0.7 million Muslims, with the remainder made up of local people and Hindus from north India.[89][90]
 Road No 13-A, Shaheen Bagh (GD Birla Marg) – Mathura Road – Kalindi Kunj – Shaheen Bagh stretch is a border point that connects New Delhi to Noida and Faridabad.
 The USCIRF had earlier expressed its support for the Lautenberg-Specter Amendments, a US law that is considered similar to the CAA.[225]

The latest in a series of such amendments is the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, introduced in parliament in July 2016 and passed in the lower house of India's parliament in January 2019. [...] The present amendment consolidates a trend that began with the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 1985, which amended the provisions pertaining to naturalisation. This gave legal expression to the Assam Accord between the Rajiv Gandhi government and the Assamese students’ organisations that had led the agitation against the enfranchisement of migrants from Bangladesh in Assam. [...] The 1985 amendment to the Citizenship Act that followed the Accord introduced a new section titled ‘Special Provisions as to Citizenship of Persons Covered by the Assam Accord’. Seeking to allay anxieties about migrants who had come in from Bangladesh [...]"

The enfranchisement of the migrants was widely attributed to the Congress. The common perception was that all Bangladeshi immigrants were Muslims, and the Congress Party was seen as the prime beneficiary of their votes. The Accord put in place measures for the detection of foreigners and their deletion from the state’s electoral rolls. [...] "As Kamal Sadiq’s book showed, ‘illegal’ migrants were more likely to be in possession of ‘documentary citizenship’—papers like ration cards and voter cards—certifying their citizenship, while natives and their descendants might well have no documentation at all"

Shōgun is a Japanese-American historical drama television miniseries created by Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks. It is based on the 1975 novel by James Clavell, which was previously adapted into a 1980 miniseries. Shōgun premiered on February 27, 2024, on Hulu and FX.

Premise
Shōgun follows "the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds and a mysterious female samurai; John Blackthorne, a risk-taking English sailor who ends up shipwrecked in Japan, a land whose unfamiliar culture will ultimately redefine him; Lord Toranaga, a shrewd, powerful daimyo, at odds with his own dangerous, political rivals; and Lady Mariko, a woman with invaluable skills but dishonorable family ties, who must prove her value and allegiance".[1][2]

Clavell's Shōgun is historical fiction. The character of Blackthorne is loosely based on the historical English navigator William Adams,[3][4] who in Japan rose to become a samurai under a powerful daimyō. That daimyō was later the founder and first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu, whose reign lasted from 1603 to his death in 1616 and on whom Shōgun's character Yoshii Toranaga is based.[5][6]

1	"Chapter One: Anjin"	Jonathan van Tulleken	Rachel Kondo & Justin Marks	February 27, 2024	0.764[9]
In 1600, the lone Dutch trading ship Erasmus [nl; ja] and its starving surviving crew arrive at Ajiro [ja] on the coast of Japan. The ship, and its deceased captain, had been part of a five-ship and 500-crew Dutch fleet, of which only the Erasmus is left. Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, the ship's English pilot, and the crew are taken prisoner by samurai warriors. The Japanese leader Taikō has recently died, leaving the rule split among five equal daimyō regents designated by the deceased Taikō to protect his child heir son, Nakamura Yaechiyo, at Osaka Castle (those being Ishido Kazunari, Sugiyama, Kiyama ukon Sadanaga, Ohno Harunobu, and Yoshii Toranaga). Toranaga is descended from the House of Minowara, a powerful family in feudal Japan. The entrenched Portuguese traders and the Portuguese Catholic Church's Jesuit order are the political and religious enemies of Blackthorne, who is Protestant. Recognizing who Blackthorne is, the local Jesuit minister immediately attempts to have Blackthorne executed by the Japanese as a pirate. However, the fief's ruler, Kashigi Yabushige, dismisses the minister's request and secretly plots to use the Erasmus and its weapons to his own benefit if war inevitably breaks out. At Osaka Castle, the other four regents initiate the process to impeach and thereby condemn to death Toranaga and all his clansmen. In order to buy time, Toranaga decides to let Lady Ochiba no Kata leave Edo for Osaka. Muraji, a spy in Ajiro, sends a message to Toranaga about the captive Blackthorne, and Toranaga orders his general, Toda Hiromatsu, to confiscate the Erasmus and its cargo and bring the foreign navigator to Osaka. Another navigator, Vasco Rodrigues, a Spaniard in service of the Portuguese, sails a Japanese ship to bring Blackthorne to Osaka, but along the way, a storm wave washes Rodrigues overboard; Blackthorne takes command of the ship and saves Rodrigues as well as his captor, Yabushige. Rodrigues' ship finally arrives in Osaka, and Blackthorne is taken to the castle, where he meets Toranaga and Lady Toda Mariko.
2	"Chapter Two: Servants of Two Masters"	Jonathan van Tulleken	Rachel Kondo & Justin Marks	February 27, 2024	0.764[9]
In 1599, the dying Taikō appoints the five regents but admits privately that he only trusts Toranaga. In 1600, Rodrigues gives Blackthorne's confiscated rutter and journal, which contains a description of the Spanish and Portuguese trade intelligence, to the Jesuits. During Blackthorne's first interview, both Mariko and the Jesuit priest Martin Alvito translate for Blackthorne, but they are interrupted by Ishido's sudden arrival. Toranaga feigns disinterest in Blackthorne and has him thrown into prison to keep him from Ishido, privately musing that he can use Blackthorne's presence to sow division between Ishido and the Christian daimyō, Kiyama and Ohno. While in prison, Blackthorne meets another Jesuit prisoner, Franciscan Friar Father Domingo. Domingo explains that Toranaga is one of five competing samurai warlords attempting to ascend to the position of shōgun, the military governor of Japan, a position vacant since 1573. He also informs Blackthorne that Toranaga is currently losing and that the Portuguese Black Ship has been taking the vast profits from the silk trade between China and Japan back to Europe using a secret military base in Macao guarded by Catholic-converted rōnin, and that the Portuguese had previously smuggled guns to Japan to incite an uprising against the Taikō. Ishido calls upon the other four busho for a vote on Toranaga's impeachment, but Kiyama and Ohno refuse to sign until Blackthorne is executed, and Ishido reluctantly agrees. Later, Toranaga's opportunistic retainer, Yabushige, convinces Ishido that Blackthorne could be useful in discerning the Christians' plans for Japan. When Blackthorne is taken to be executed by Kiyama's men, he is rescued by Yabushige and his samurai posing as bandits. In a second interview with Toranaga (with Mariko serving this time as sole translator), Blackthorne explains that Portugal and Spain have divided the world among themselves and reveals that their end goal is to replace all non-Catholic governments with Catholic ones, and shares the existence of the secret base in Macao. Toranaga, Mariko, and all Japanese present are shocked to hear how all of Japan "belongs" to the King of Portugal, and in retaliation for this presumption, Toranaga bars the Portuguese Black Ship from leaving Osaka. That night, a ninja assassin sent by Kiyama on behalf of the Jesuits tries to kill Blackthorne but Toranaga had secretly switched rooms with Blackthorne and surprises the assassin. Blackthorne comes to his aid and the two defeat the assassin together.

3	"Chapter Three: Tomorrow Is Tomorrow"	Charlotte Brändström	Shannon Goss	March 5, 2024	0.492[11]
Yabushige writes his will before meeting with Toranaga, believing he will be put to death. Instead, Toranaga promises him a larger fief and instructs him to move Blackthorne and Toranaga's wife, Lady Kiri No Kata to Ajiro. In the Portuguese headquarters, the Black Ship's captain, Captain-General Ferriera rebuffs Toranaga's ban on the Black Ship leaving. Disregarding the Jesuits' concerns over having the Black Ship leave Osaka without formal authorization, Ferriera instructs Rodrigues to prepare the Black Ship to leave that same night. At Osaka Castle, the caravan escorting Blackthorne, including Yabushige, Toda Buntaro (Mariko's husband), Kiri, and Toranaga's son, Yoshii Nagakado, prepares to leave for Ajiro. Before they can do so, Ishido arrives to inspect the caravan under the guise of paying respects. Toranaga secretly takes his wife's place in the litter, which Blackthorne witnesses. Informed by Mariko that if this subterfuge is discovered, they will all be killed, Blackthorne creates a scene feigning outraged at their invasion of Kiri's privacy. The caravan manages to leave the castle, escorted by Ishido's men. Later that night, while the caravan is on the move, Kiyama's men launch a surprised attack. Upon discovering that they were escorting Toranaga, Ishido's men turn against Toranaga's party. The party makes it to Osaka's harbor, with Buntaro staying behind to stall pursuit, and escapes aboard a Japanese galley. Seeing that Kiyama's men were blocking the harbor with fishing boats, Toranaga boards the Black Ship and strikes a deal with the Portuguese, offering them clearance to leave, a sum of silver coins, and permission to build a church in Edo in exchange for passage on their ship. Toranaga also tries to convince them to sway the Christian regents in his favor, but in turn, the Portuguese demand that Blackthorne is left in their hands. Ferriera, Rodrigues, and Toranaga's party sail away on the Black Ship, but Blackthorne follows it in the galley and rejoins the Black Ship once both ships have broken the blockade. Once safe at sea, Toranaga makes Blackthorne a hatamoto and asks him to teach Western tactics to a new regiment and to show him how to dive. In Osaka, Hiromatsu informs the regents that Toranaga has resigned from his position, which means they no longer have the quorum to vote on his impeachment.
4	"Chapter Four: The Eightfold Fence"	Frederick E.O. Toye	Nigel Williams & Emily Yoshida	March 12, 2024	0.517[13]
Upon the galley's arrival in Ajiro, Toranaga inspects Yabushige's army before departing for Edo. Blackthorne is informed by Mariko that his crew were relocated to Edo, and that they and the Erasmus now belong to Toranaga. Furthermore, he is given a home, a healthy salary, and Usami Fuji, Hiromatsu's granddaughter, as his consort, provided that he trains Yabushige's army on combat tactics for six months. Meanwhile, Yabushige's nephew, Kashigi Omi, suggests to Yabushige that in Toranaga's absence, Yabushige can take the confiscated Erasmus guns and cannons and offer them to Ishido. During the first week of training, Blackthorne teaches the army the basics of English naval combat, first by helping them improve their efficiency with the cannons. Later, Nebara Jozen, Ishido's aide, arrives and tells Yabushige to return to Osaka to pledge his loyalty to the remaining daimyō regents. Knowing that his return to Osaka will most likely end in his death by seppuku, Yabushige invites Jozen to stay the night and for a demonstration of the cannons the next day. At dinner, Blackthorne gives Fuji one of his guns as a token of gratitude; in exchange, she gives him her late father's swords. Mariko sneaks into Blackthorne's room at night and sleeps with him, later claiming the next morning she and Fuji hired a courtesan for him. The next day, during the demonstration, Nagakado takes matters into his own hands and kills Jozen and his retinue with chain shots from the cannons, much to the chagrin of Yabushige.

The episode is dedicated to the memory of crew member Larry Beckett, who worked as a cannon expert and technical advisor.[12]
5	"Chapter Five: Broken to the Fist"	Frederick E.O. Toye	Matt Lambert	March 19, 2024	0.554[14]
Toranaga returns to Ajiro with his entire army, and upon learning of Nagakado's killing of Jozen, he strips him of his command of the cannon regiment and gives the position to Omi. Having survived the ordeal in Osaka to escape to Edo, Buntaro moves in to live with Blackthorne and Mariko. Blackthorne is gifted a freshly killed pheasant by Toranaga, which he hangs in the front yard of his house to age and instructs the household not to touch it until it matures. During dinner, Blackthorne and Buntaro engage in a sake drinking binge before Buntaro proves his archery skills while drunk and forces Mariko to tell Blackthorne about how her father, Lord Akechi Jinsai, murdered Lord Kuroda, the previous ruler of Japan before the Taikō, and was forced to execute his family before committing seppuku, and that she married Buntaro and was forced to live as atonement for her father's crime. Later that night, upon learning that Mariko has been assaulted by Buntaro, Blackthorne confronts him outside, but Buntaro lays down his sword and apologizes for disturbing his home. The next day, after a long discussion with Mariko, Blackthorne returns home to discover that Uejiro, the house's gardener, took down the rotting pheasant and buried it under orders from Muraji, the village headman, and was executed for his action. Blackthorne declines Fuji's request to kill her for disobeying his orders and approaches Toranaga with a request to permanently leave Japan. A massive earthquake causes a landslide and Blackthorne rescues Toranaga from being buried alive. Blackthorne returns to a heavily damaged Ajiro and discovers that Fuji had been injured. The following day, Muraji leads Yabushige and Omi to Uejirou's hut and manages to convince them that he was the spy that they were searching for. In Osaka, the remaining regents debate on who will take Toranaga's place on the council. Ochiba finally arrives and reunites with Yaechiyo before telling Ishido that the council will now listen to her.

Production

Hiroyuki Sanada, one of the producers of the series, portrays Lord Yoshii Toranaga.
Development
During the Television Critics Association's annual summer press tour in August 2018, FX announced it would make a new adaptation of the 1975 novel Shōgun by James Clavell and had given the production a straight-to-series order. Executive producers were expected to include Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Michael De Luca, Michaela Clavell, Tim Van Patten, Eugene Kelly, and Ronan Bennett. Rachel Bennette is set as a supervising producer, Tom Winchester as a producer, Georgina Pope as a co-producer, and Eriko Miyagawa as an associate producer. Patten will also direct the series, and Bennett will also write. FX Productions is slated to serve as the production company for the series. Hiroyuki Sanada serves as a producer and lead actor.[1][20]

In an interview with USA Today, Sanada expressed his role as a producer, saying "After 20 years in Hollywood, I'm a producer. It means I can say anything, anytime. [...] I had a team for the first time, ever. I carried the pressure of being a producer on my shoulder. But more than that, I had happiness." He also stressed keeping the show authentic to Japanese history. "If something is incorrect, people cannot focus on the drama. They don't want to see that kind of show. We needed to be authentic."[21]

Filming
Principal photography for the series was scheduled to commence in March 2019 in Japan and the United Kingdom,[22] but was delayed because the network felt that the production wasn't in good enough shape and that they wanted to aim higher.[23] Sanada did a single day of filming in 2019 in order for FX to retain the rights to the property as the series was being retooled.[24]

In January 2020, it was revealed that after original writer Ronan Bennett was no longer available to keep working on scripts, they started over from scratch with new writer and executive producer Justin Marks, working alongside his wife, supervising producer Rachel Kondo. The series' writing team also includes co-executive producer Shannon Goss, consulting producer Matt Lambert, script editor Maegan Houang, and staff writer Emily Yoshida.[25]

On September 22, 2021, principal photography for the series began in Vancouver and Ireland, lasting until June 30, 2022, two months longer than expected.[26][27] Nikkan Gendai reported that Japanese extras were paid 50,000 yen per day, which is much higher than a Japanese production where they are paid between zero yen to 5,000 yen a day.[28] A Japanese white pine tree used on set was donated and planted after filming to the City Hall of Port Moody.[29][30]

Marketing
To promote the series, an immersive exhibition of the series occurred at FX Lawn during San Diego Comic Con in July 2023. These included samurai performances and a virtual koi pond.[31] On September 5, 2023, the series was teased in a showcase of upcoming FX television shows.[32] On November 2, 2023, the show's first trailer debuted on YouTube, which revealed that the series would be released in February 2024 on Hulu.[2] A 30-second trailer for the series aired during the second-quarter of Super Bowl LVIII on February 11, 2024. Bill Bradley of Adweek wrote "The series has been in the works for years and is already the most expensive in FX history, so what's another $7 million-ish for an ad?"[33]

Release
Shōgun premiered with its first two episodes on February 27, 2024, on Hulu and FX. The remainder of the 10-episode series will release weekly. Internationally, the series will be available on Disney+ and Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ (via Star in other territories.[34]) An English dub of the series is available on Hulu.[35] A companion podcast was also released for each episode.[36]

Reception
Audience viewership
According to viewer tracking application Samba TV, Shōgun was the most streamed program across all platforms between February 26 and March 3, 2024.[37][38] It was also the most streamed program across all platforms during its second week.[39] TheWrap noted that Shōgun was one of the few non-Netflix series to have a back-to-back number one ranking.[40] On March 6, 2024, it was revealed the show drew 9 million views across Hulu, Disney+, and Star+ in its first six days of release.[41][42] The streaming aggregator Reelgood reported the miniseries was the most streamed program in the United States through March 6, 2024.[43] From March 4 to March 10, 2024, Shōgun was the most streamed television series in Canada,[44] and in the United States,[45] according to the streaming aggregator JustWatch.

Critical response
Shōgun received critical acclaim worldwide.[46][47] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 99% of 88 critics gave the series a positive review. The site's critical consensus is, "Visually sumptuous and enriched with cultural verisimilitude, Shōgun is an epic adaptation that outdoes the original."[48] On Metacritic, the series holds a weighted average score of 85 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[47]

Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian praised the show, calling it "mesmerising" and especially praised the battle sequences and its respect for the source material.[49] Writing for The New York Times, Mike Hale compared the show to the 1980 adaptation, writing "You can correct for wooden acting, dated production values and Eurocentrism, but you can't really correct for the basic nature of the material." He especially praised the show for highlighting more of the Japanese characters than in the 1980 adaptation, which focused more on Blackthorne. His only complaints are Cosmo Jarvis' more neutered portrayal of Blackthorne and the Western-written source material.[50] Forbes described the show as an "instant hit" and praised Jarvis' portrayal of Blackthorne, stating "I'm immediately drawn to his character because he's not just some good guy, some white savior or what have you. He's smart but he's also calculating and ruthless."[51] Anita Singh of the Telegraph awarded the series four stars out of five, writing that “Disney's glossy adaptation of James Clavell's bloody novel – set in Japan in 1600 – looks great and feels unapologetically macho.”[52]

Empire headlined their review by Jake Cunnigham with "Shōgun makes for gripping television. Look past the knotty bureaucracy and you'll find striking performances and stunning visuals", highlighting the intricate performances of its lead trio. He describes Jarvis as "compelling" and "magnetic", Hiroyuki Sanada as a "subdued lord [who] ripples with menace, micro-expressions of warfaring arithmetic revealing his tactical mind" and Anna Sawai as "a character torn in duty and spirituality, cloaked in a performance of stoicism".[53] The Hollywood Reporter also praised the supporting cast, notably Moeka Hoshi, Tadanobu Asano, Fumi Nikaido, Shinosuke Abe and Tokuma Nishioka for their strong character work.[54] IGN described some of the supporting cast as "stand-out", praising Néstor Carbonell as Rodrigues and Tadanobu Asano as Yabushige next to Jarvis' Blackthorne, "a force to be reckoned with".[55]

Series creators Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks's adaptation of the novel also received positive responses, with Daniel Fienberg from The Hollywood Reporter stating that "this Shōgun finds much more traction as an ambitious game of political chess."[54] IGN writes "Creators Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo have crafted a version of feudal Japan filled with visual splendor, brutality, and intrigue" whilst remaining "Highly faithful to James Clavell's bestselling novel".[55] For Variety, Alison Herman attributes the show's success to "creators Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo have tapped into the true secret sauce of epic television: a balance between sweeping grandeur and intimate psychology."[56]

Reception in Japan
In Japan, the series was acclaimed by audiences on Eiga.com [ja].[57] Japanese comedian and history buff Kunihiro Matsumura also praised the series for its authenticity. Ken Matsudaira, who played Tokugawa Yoshimune in The Unfettered Shogun and played Tokugawa Ieyasu (who was the model for the main character, Yoshii Toranaga) three times in his acting career, praised Sanada's skilled acting and his effort to bring more historical authenticity to the series, for which Sanada also serves as a producer.[58] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sanada expressed his thoughts on the show's Japanese reception. "I was a little worried about the Japanese reaction because they know what is authentic, and what is not. But surprisingly, all the reviews and the reactions from the audience were great. That was exactly what we wanted."[59]

Acclaimed video game designer Hideo Kojima, known for founding Kojima Productions, gave the series a glowing review, likening it to "a Game of Thrones set in 17th century Japan", and praised the show's scale, details, cast, costumes, sets, props, and VFX, as well as citing star and producer Hiroyuki Sanada's presence in the series.[60]

Theodore Peter James Kinnaird Taptiklis (born 16 December 1984), known professionally as Theo James, is an English actor. He gained recognition for playing Tobias Eaton in The Divergent Series film trilogy (2014–2016). He has starred in the horror films Underworld: Awakening (2012) and Underworld: Blood Wars (2016) and the science fiction film Archive (2020).

In television, he appeared in the crime drama series Golden Boy (2012), the romance series The Time Traveler's Wife (2022), and the dark comedy series The White Lotus (2022), which earned him a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award. In 2024, he played the lead role in Guy Ritchie's action comedy series The Gentlemen.

Early life
Theodore Peter James Kinnaird Taptiklis was born in High Wycombe on 16 December 1984.[1][2] He is the son of Philip Taptiklis, a business consultant, and Jane (née Martin), who worked for the National Health Service.[3][4][5] He is of Greek and Scottish descent.[6] He has two older brothers and two older sisters.[6][7]

James was raised in Askett.[8] He attended Aylesbury Grammar School and earned his undergraduate degree in philosophy from the University of Nottingham. He trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.[9][10]

Career
In 2010, James made his television debut in two episodes of A Passionate Woman.[10][11] The same year he played Turkish diplomat Kemal Pamuk in an episode of the first season of Downton Abbey.[12] His film credits include You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010). James was cast in Stranger while still in his final year at drama school. He was named a "Star of Tomorrow" in 2009 by Screen International.[13]

In 2011, James starred in the short-lived horror series Bedlam, playing the lead role of Jed Harper. That same year, he also played James, an obnoxious night club rep, in the British comedy The Inbetweeners Movie (2011).

In 2012, James appeared in the miniseries Room at the Top as Jack Wales and ITV's Case Sensitive as Aiden Harper.[14] He was in the films The Domino Effect (2012) and Underworld: Awakening (2012), playing the role of David in the latter opposite Kate Beckinsale.[15] He reprised his character David in the fifth Underworld film, as the film's male lead.[16][17] James starred as Detective Walter William Clark Jr. in the American crime-drama series Golden Boy (2013), which aired for one season.[18]

James' breakthrough role was his portrayal of Tobias "Four" Eaton in Divergent (2014), the film adaptation based on the New York Times bestselling novels by Veronica Roth.[19] James reprised the character in the sequel, The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015).[20] He returned in one more Divergent film, The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016). James performed his own stunts in the film series.[21]

James starred alongside Amber Heard, Billy Bob Thornton and Jim Sturgess in the film adaptation of London Fields,[22] and in the indie drama The Benefactor (2015), with Richard Gere and Dakota Fanning.[23][24] James executive produced and starred as Michael in Backstabbing for Beginners (2018). He starred as Will Younger in the Netflix film How It Ends (2018).

In 2019, James executive produced and played Sidney Parker in the British series Sanditon as a male lead. It is an eight-part period-drama adaptation of Jane Austen's final novel, written only months before her death in 1817. James will not reprise his role for the series' second and third seasons. He then executive produced and starred in the film Lying and Stealing. James launched his own film and TV production company, named Untapped, that same year.[25]

James produced and appeared in the 2020 science fiction film Archive, playing a robotics scientist working on a secret project involving building a prototype based on his dead wife.[26] He stars in the romance series The Time Traveler's Wife, which premiered in May 2022. The Hollywood Reporter's Angie Han described James's portrayal of the titular time traveler "dashing and a little sardonic" and highlighted his and co-star Rose Leslie's "inability to generate any real sparks between them".[27] James plays a series regular role in the second season of the satire series The White Lotus.[28]

In 2024, he starred as Edward "Eddie" Horniman, Duke of Halstead, alongside Kaya Scodelario, Daniel Ings, and Ray Winstone, in the Guy Ritchie television series The Gentlemen (2024 TV series), streamed on Netflix.[29]

Personal life
James is married to Irish actress Ruth Kearney. The two met at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.[30] They divide their time between Venice Beach, California and North London.[1] They have a daughter, born in 2021 and another baby born in September 2023.[31][32]

Outside his acting career, James was the singer and guitarist of the London-based band Shere Khan, which disbanded in 2012.[33] In 2015, he became the brand ambassador for Hugo Boss fragrances for men, appearing in print ads and commercials.[34]

In June 2016, James travelled to Greece with UNHCR, where he met Syrian refugees and learned more about their situation.[35] He has since been a supporter of refugees' rights and called for greater humanitarian aid for people displaced by the Syrian Civil War.[36][37][38]

Kabir Rishi, a Chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti reside in Dehradun, Uttarakhand with their kids Janhvi and Dhruv. They schedule a vacation at their farmhouse in a remote hill station. Midway, they stop by a roadside eatery and acquaint themselves with an enigmatic mid-aged man, who introduces himself as Vanraj Kashyap. Janhvi undergoes an incomprehensible change after gulping down a Laddu given by Vanraj and craves to do everything he asks for. Before they depart, Vanraj gives Janhvi a packet of biscuits to eat after reaching the farmhouse and she takes them before joining her family at the swimming pool.

Subsequently, Vanraj inexplicably arrives at the farmhouse and citing that his phone's battery has died, he asks them to let him stay over till it gets charged. Though Kabir agrees, Jyoti remains suspicious, wondering how he has gotten to know the farmhouse's location. Vanraj and Janhvi engage in a conversation and she discloses about her boyfriend when Dhruv interrupts and insists on playing with Janhvi; Vanraj instructs her to frighten him. Janhvi gets on a swing with her brother and swings swiftly, petrifying Dhruv. Kabir and Jyoti reprimand Janhvi for her mischievous deed while Vanraj interferes too much in their personal discussion, infuriating Kabir, who tells him to leave. When Vanraj vehemently refuses, Kabir starts dragging him out but Janhvi, upon being asked by Vanraj to resist her father, stops Kabir violently and declares that Vanraj will not go anywhere; she even breaks up with her boyfriend at Vanraj's behest, stunning her parents. Vanraj reveals to Kabir and Jyoti that he has hypnotized Janhvi through Black magic and states that she will obey every command of his and asks them to give her away to him. When they deny, Vanraj dictates Janhvi to laugh, then cry, to break all the mobile phones, eat teapowder, slap Kabir and bang her brother's head on the staircase; she complies to all the instructions, leaving Kabir and Jyoti shattered.

Having received a phone call from Jyoti through a cellphone she has kept hidden, two police officials arrive at the farmhouse to check upon the family. Nevertheless, Vanraj instructs Janhvi to explode the gas cylinder in the kitchen if her parents disclose the truth to the police, prompting Kabir and Jyoti to cover it up in the police's presence. They hide Dhruv, who is profusely bleeding, in the bedroom and lie to the police that the phone calls were made to them by Dhruv for fun. The police leave upon corroborating no suspicious activity. Kabir offers to give all the money he has to Vanraj in exchange for sparing Janhvi and he agrees; after Vanraj exits with the money, Kabir and Jyoti realize that he hasn't yet freed Janhvi from the spell and rush outdoors to see him setting the money on fire. Declaring that he is not submissive to materialistic things and aims to achieve something superior on that fateful night, he reenters their farmhouse and orders Janhvi to slap herself and then to dance continuously, exhausting her. He instructs her to slit Jyoti's throat with a knife when she tries to comfort her, prompting her to back off. He goes to sleep, commanding Janhvi to guard him. Janhvi involuntarily urinates in her shorts and Jyoti abundantly pleads with Vanraj to let her clean Janhvi up and change her pants but Vanraj orders her to do the latter only.

Kabir and Jyoti manage to subdue Janhvi and pounce on Vanraj but the latter orders Janhvi to keep laughing and threatens Kabir that even if he is killed, Janhvi will keep on laughing till she dies. This compels Kabir to spare him but Vanraj, thereupon, instructs Janhvi to kill Dhruv. She goes after Dhruv and repels her parents' attempts in desisting her and throws him off the terrace, almost fatally wounding him. Vanraj then pressurizes Kabir and Jyoti to give Janhvi away and takes her away; unbeknownst to him, Kabir follows them to his lair, having fixed a tracker in his cellphone's settings while Jyoti takes Dhruv to an hospital. Vanraj has kept 100 other girls in his lair and prepares to sacrifice them by making them jump into a huge pyre to acquire something superhuman. Kabir intrudes on the ritual, cuts Vanraj's tongue off and throws it into the pyre; when the girls try to assault him, he plays an edited recording of Vanraj's words to them, in which he declares their freedom, which is actually uttered in another context. Thus, all the girls escape Vanraj's control and return to their normal selves. Kabir's family reconciles at the hospital. All the other girls safely head to their homes with the police's help.The police assure Kabir that they'll catch Vanraj soon, but he's still running.

A year later, Kabir heads to an isolated place where he has held Vanraj captive and gives him a dead rat. He tells Vanraj that a father can go to any extent to protect his family and exits the place, ignoring Vanraj's plea.

Reception
Critical response
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 43% of 14 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.3/10.[16]

Bollywood Hungama gave 4/5 stars and wrote "Shaitaan is a nail-biting thriller laced with superlative performances and clapworthy climax that keeps you engaged".[17] Dhaval Roy of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 and wrote "Even though Shaitaan’s narrative stumbles at times, the masterful use of atmosphere and top-notch acting elevate it into an unsettling experience worth having".[18]

Sana Farzeen of India Today gave the film 2.5/5 and wrote "Shaitaan falls short, probably cursed by a weak script and the pressure of helming a remake".[19] Lachmi Deb Roy of Firstpost rated 2.5 out of 5 and opined "Shaitaan could have been a good supernatural thriller, which we haven’t seen much in Hindi cinema of late, but it turned out to be a complete mess in the process of depicting the war of good vs evil. It’s a poorly made remake and the story is just not believable. Making the hero win at the end makes the film just too predictable".[20] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 1.5/5 and wrote "Jyothika is the only one in the cast who is able to rise a bit above the sheer absurdity of the proceedings. The two male characters and the actors playing them don't stand a chance".[21]

Box office
As of 21 March 2024, Shaitaan has grossed ₹140.1 crore (US$18 million) in India, with a further ₹27.22 crore (US$3.4 million) in overseas, for a worldwide total of ₹167.32 crore (US$21 million).[5]

Signature

Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (/ˈaɪlɪʃ/ EYE-lish;[2] born December 18, 2001) is an American singer and songwriter. She first gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single "Ocean Eyes", written and produced by her brother Finneas O'Connell, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. In 2017, she released her debut extended play (EP), Don't Smile at Me. Commercially successful, it reached the top 15 of record charts in numerous countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

Eilish's first studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019), debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart. It was one of the year's best-selling albums, buoyed by the success of its fifth single, "Bad Guy", Eilish's first number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100. This made her the first artist born in the 21st century to release a chart-topping single. The next year, Eilish performed the theme song "No Time to Die" for the James Bond film of the same name, which topped the UK Singles Chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. Her subsequent singles "Everything I Wanted", "My Future", "Therefore I Am", and "Your Power" peaked in the top 10 in the US and UK. Her second studio album, Happier Than Ever (2021), topped the charts in 25 countries. She wrote and performed "What Was I Made For?" from the fantasy film Barbie (2023), which became her second number-one single in the UK and earned her a second Academy Award win.

Eilish has received multiple accolades, including nine Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, three Brit Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and two Academy Awards. She is the youngest artist in Grammy history to win all four general field categories—Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, as well as Best New Artist—in the same year. She is also the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] During the 96th Academy Awards, she became, along with her brother Finneas, the youngest 2-time Academy Award winner ever with their win for "What Was I Made For?".[4] She was featured on Time magazine's inaugural Time 100 Next list in 2019 and the Time 100 in 2021.[5] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Billboard, Eilish is the 26th-highest-certified digital singles artist[6] and one of the most successful artists of the 2010s.[7] She was honored as one of the BBC 100 Women in December 2022.[8]

Eilish has a history of political activism, focusing on climate change awareness, body positivity, women's reproductive rights, and gender equality.

Early life

Eilish with her mother, Maggie Baird, in November 2018
Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001.[9] She is the daughter of actress and teacher Maggie Baird[10][11] and actor Patrick O'Connell,[12] both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours.[13][14][15] Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.[16] She was conceived via in vitro fertilization.[17] Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate was to be her middle name.[18] She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[19][20]

Eilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.[12][15] Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting.[21] Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.[22] Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting.[13][21] Eilish performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.[23][21] At age six, she started playing the ukulele.[24] She wrote her first "real" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead, from which she took script lines and episode titles.[25][22] Eilish took some acting auditions, which she disliked, but she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Ramona and Beezus, and the X-Men series.[21] Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a growth plate injury ended her dance career and she focused on recording music.[26][27][23]

Career
2015–2017: Don't Smile at Me
Main article: Don't Smile at Me
In 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band.[27][23][14] The first songs they recorded together were called "She's Broken" and "Fingers Crossed", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. "We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun," she recalled.[28]

On November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song "Ocean Eyes". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals.[14][29][23][27] He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz could access and download it.[27][23][30][31] The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. Rukasin felt she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.[36]

In January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract.[34][13][33] Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.[13] On March 24, 2016, a music video for "Ocean Eyes" directed by Megan Thompson premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel.[37] "Ocean Eyes" and Eilish received praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC Radio 1, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.[41]

On June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released "Six Feet Under" on SoundCloud as her second single.[42] A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016.[43] It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.[43]

In August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent in 2015 when he first heard "Ocean Eyes", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope Records.[32][44] He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a "persona and distinct aesthetic".[26] Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released "Six Feet Under" and "Ocean Eyes" as singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively.[45][46] On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for "Ocean Eyes" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.[47]


Eilish performing in August 2017
On January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for "Ocean Eyes",[48] and another EP for "Six Feet Under" featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica.[49] After the success of the "Ocean Eyes" remixes, Eilish released "Bellyache" on February 24, 2017.[50] A video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, directed by Miles and AJ.[51] Eilish released "Bored" on March 30, 2017, as part of the soundtrack to the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why.[52] A video for "Bored" was released on June 26, 2017.[53] In March of the same year, Apple Music showcased Eilish at the South by Southwest music festival.[34][38] On June 30, 2017, Eilish released "Watch".[54] Eilish released another single, "Copycat", on July 14, 2017,[55] and announced the release of her debut EP, Don't Smile at Me.[56] Eilish later released "Idontwannabeyouanymore" and "My Boy".[57][58] On August 11, 2017, Eilish released Don't Smile at Me.[59] The EP was a sleeper hit, reaching number 14 on the US Billboard 200.[60] Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour throughout October 2017 in support of her EP.[61] Eilish released "Bitches Broken Hearts" through SoundCloud on November 10, 2017.[62][63][64][65]

Eilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, "Today's Top Hits".[13] The Baffler described Eilish's sound as fitting into the "streambait" genre consisting of largely "mid-tempo, melancholy pop" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose "singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production" shaped the aesthetic.[66][13] Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion.[13] In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP, and an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1.[67] That month, the live EP, Up Next Session: Billie Eilish, was released. On December 15, 2017, Eilish released her collaboration with American rapper Vince Staples, "&Burn", a remix of her single "Watch". It was included on the expanded edition of Don't Smile at Me.[68][69][70][71]

In February 2018, Eilish embarked on her second headlining concert tour, the Where's My Mind Tour, which concluded in April 2018.[72] "Bitches Broken Hearts" was re-released worldwide on March 30, 2018.[73] For Record Store Day 2018, Eilish released "Party Favor" on a pink 7-inch vinyl, along with a cover of "Hotline Bling", by Drake, as the B-side.[74] Eilish collaborated with American singer Khalid on the single "Lovely", which was released on April 19, 2018, and added to the soundtrack for the second season of 13 Reasons Why.[75] She released "You Should See Me in a Crown" in July 2018,[76] The same month, Eilish performed at the Mo Pop Festival.[77]


Eilish at Pukkelpop Festival in 2019
On the day of release for her single "When the Party's Over",[78] Eilish was featured in Vanity Fair's "73 Questions" rapid-fire questionnaire video series by Joe Sabia, who revisited an interview from October 2017. The resulting video was a side-by-side time capsule of both interviews showing her growth in popularity over one year.[79] She signed a talent contract with Next Management for fashion and beauty endorsements in October 2018.[80][81] She was placed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in November of that year,[82][83] and released the single "Come Out and Play" in November 2018, which was written for a holiday-themed Apple Inc. commercial.[84] In early January 2019, Don't Smile at Me reached 1 billion streams on Spotify, making her the youngest artist to top 1 billion streams on a project.[13] That month, Eilish released "Bury a Friend" as the third single from her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?,[85][86] along with "When I Was Older", a single inspired by the 2018 film Roma, which appeared on the compilation album Music Inspired by the Film Roma.[87][88] In February, Eilish partnered with YouTube on a documentary miniseries, "A Snippet Into Billie's Mind".[34][89] "Wish You Were Gay", her fourth single from the album, was released on March 4, 2019.[90]

When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? was released on March 29, 2019.[91] Spotify launched a "multi-level campaign behind the album", creating a multimedia playlist and "new product features" that Spotify said "allow for vertical video content, custom assets, and editorial storylines, all with the goal of creating more meaningful and engaging context for [Eilish's] fans."[34] In Los Angeles, Spotify set up a "pop-up enhanced album experience", which included different artwork and a "multi-sensory" experience of each track for fans.[34] The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 as well as on the UK Albums Chart, making Eilish the first artist born in the 2000s to have a number-one album in the U.S. and the youngest female ever to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom.[20][92] Upon the album's debut, Eilish broke the record for most simultaneously charting Hot 100 songs by a female artist, with 14, after every song from the album, excluding "Goodbye", charted on the Hot 100.[93] The fifth single from the album, "Bad Guy", was released in conjunction with the album.[94] A remix of the song featuring Justin Bieber was released in July 2019.[95][96] In August, Bad Guy peaked at number-one in the US, ending Lil Nas X's record-breaking 19 weeks at number-one with "Old Town Road".[97] She is the first artist born in the 2000s and the youngest artist since Lorde (with "Royals") to have a number-one single.[98]

World Tour.[102] The tour began in Miami on March 9, 2020, and ran for two more shows on March 10 in Orlando and March 12 in Raleigh before Eilish ended the tour prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was set to conclude in Jakarta on September 7.[103]

On November 7, 2019, Jack White's Third Man Records announced that the label would release an acoustic live album of Eilish's performance from the record label's Blue Room, exclusively sold on vinyl at Third Man retail locations in Nashville, Tennessee, and Detroit, Michigan.[104] On November 13, 2019, she released her next single, "Everything I Wanted".[105] On November 20, 2019, Eilish was nominated for six Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for "Bad Guy" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. At age 17, she became the youngest artist to be nominated in all four General Field categories.[106] In the same month, Eilish was crowned 2019's Billboard Woman of the Year.[107]

On January 14, 2020, Eilish was announced as performer of the title track for the 25th installment in the James Bond film franchise, No Time to Die,[108] written and produced with her brother. With this announcement, Eilish became the youngest artist to write and perform a James Bond theme song.[109] It became the second Bond theme song to top the British official charts and the first Bond theme performed by a female artist to do so. It was also Eilish's first number-one single in the UK.[110] At the 62nd Grammy Awards, she became the youngest person to win the four main Grammy categories – Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year – in the same year.[111][112] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eilish and her brother performed for both iHeart Media's Living Room Concert for America,[113] and Global Citizen's Together at Home concert series, singing a cover of Bobby Hebb's "Sunny" for the latter.[114] Both virtual concerts were an effort to raise awareness and funds towards fighting the disease.[113][114] On April 10, 2020, "Ilomilo" was sent to Italian contemporary hit radio stations by Universal Music Group, as When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'s seventh and final single.[115] On July 30, 2020, Eilish released "My Future", her first original release since "No Time to Die", along with an animated video.[116] In 2020, she became the youngest person to feature on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, with earnings of $53 million.[117] In September 2020, Eilish released a collection of branded ukuleles with guitar manufacturer Fender.[118]

In October 2020, Eilish announced a livestream concert titled Where Do We Go? The Livestream set to air from Los Angeles on October 24, with proceeds from the show's merchandise raising funds to support event crew members affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[119] In a Vanity Fair interview, Eilish said she was working on "sixteen new songs and lov[ing] them all", revealing an upcoming musical project.[120] Eilish won three Billboard Music Awards on October 24—Billboard Music Award for Top Female Artist, Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album (When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?), and Billboard Music Award for Top New Artist—out of the 12 that she was nominated for. Also that month, she announced a new single, "Therefore I Am", which was released along with its video on November 12, 2020.[121] Eilish performed "Therefore I Am" and "My Future" at the Jingle Ball in December 2020.[122]

Since 2021: Happier Than Ever and Guitar Songs

"Lo Vas a Olvidar", a single featuring Rosalía as a part of HBO's Euphoria soundtrack, was released in January 2021, almost two years after initially teasing the song.[123] The R. J. Cutler–directed documentary film Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry was released on Apple TV+ and in select movie theaters. The film was praised by critics and fans for its in-depth look at Eilish's personal life during her ascent to fame.[124] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Eilish took home two awards: the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media for her Bond theme and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for "Everything I Wanted". In her acceptance speech for Record of the Year, Eilish said that Megan Thee Stallion "deserved to win", but still thanked her fans and her brother for her award.[125]

2021 saw the publication of her personally selected comprehensive book of photographs that shared "an intimate window into her life" on and off stage, By - Billie Eilish.[126]

On April 27, 2021, Eilish announced on her Instagram account that her second album, Happier Than Ever, would be released on July 30, and the tracklist was made available on Apple Music. The album was released in various formats, including collectible vinyl and cassette colors.[127][128] The album's release was preceded by five singles: "My Future", "Therefore I Am", "Your Power",[129] "Lost Cause",[130] and "NDA",[131] and was accompanied by the title track. On December 2, 2021, Eilish announced an eco-friendly limited-edition vinyl version of Happier Than Ever made from recycled vinyl scraps. The collector's item was available only at a number of Gucci stores around the world and included Gucci-branded nail stickers designed by the brand's creative director, Alessandro Michele.[132] To further promote the album, Eilish worked with Disney+ on the concert film Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, released in September 2021,[133][134] and embarked on the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour in February 2022, concluding it in April 2023.[135]

In June 2021, Eilish was criticized online for videos in which she mouthed the anti-Asian slur "chink" while lip-syncing the song "Fish" by Tyler, the Creator,[136][137] while Matthew Tyler Vorce, her reported boyfriend at the time, received criticism for alleged social media posts in which he used offensive language and slurs against gay and Black people.[140] Eilish was also accused of queerbaiting after using the caption "I love girls" to promote the music video for "Lost Cause".[141][142][better source needed] On June 22, she posted an apology to Instagram stories for her usage of "chink", saying that she was "appalled and embarrassed" by the video and that she was "13 or 14" at the time and did not know the slur was a derogatory term.[143][144] She also addressed a separate video of what was viewed as her mocking an Asian accent, writing that she was actually "speaking in a silly gibberish made up voice".[143][144] Reflecting on the events in a July 2021 interview, Eilish said: "I said so many things then that I totally don't agree with now, or think the opposite thing. The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to."[145]


Eilish during the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour (2022)
Eilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album's songs with Finneas in December 2021.[146] In a July 2022 interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she said she hoped to start writing the album in 2023.[147] In 2022, Eilish won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song "No Time to Die" from the film of the same name, becoming the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] That same year, she became the youngest headliner to date for two festivals, specifically Glastonbury and Coachella.[148][149] The Pixar film Turning Red was released that year, for which she and Finneas wrote three songs, "Nobody Like U", "U Know What's Up" and "1 True Love", performed by Turning Red's fictional boy band 4*Town.[150]

In June 2022, during her world tour's Manchester show, Eilish debuted the then-unreleased ballad "TV". The song references the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a case that made abortion a constitutional right in the US.[151] The next month, on July 21, she surprise-released the two-track EP Guitar Songs, which includes "TV" alongside "The 30th".[152] Eilish explained her decision to surprise-release the EP during the interview with Lowe. She told him that while work on her third studio album was coming soon, she refused to wait until that time to put "TV" and "The 30th" on a track list. She wanted to spread their messages to her fans as soon as possible, noting the immediacy of its lyrics: "These songs are really current for me, and they're songs that I want to have said right now."[153] Another reason was Eilish had grown tired of doing heavy, traditional promotion for upcoming music. She wanted to release songs like she had early in her career, previewing them for fans in live concerts before releasing them without much marketing.[154][155]

Eilish worked with Apple Music to exclusively host a film of one of the Happier Than Ever tour concerts, specifically one of her shows at The O2 Arena in London. She billed the film as a way for fans who missed out on tickets to experience the tour, wanting more people to recognize her showmanship live.[156][157][158] Three concerts, titled Happier Than Ever, The Hometown Encore, were held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, from December 13 to 16, 2022, as part of the tour.[159][160]

Eilish wrote the song "What Was I Made For?" for the soundtrack of the 2023 movie Barbie. According to statements posted on her social media, she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the movie during its production.[161] In 2024, she won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and two Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media for her Barbie ballad. The song became the tenth song in history to win both an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Eilish became the youngest person to win two Academy Awards in any category.[162] Eilish made her acting debut in Amazon Prime Video's Swarm.[163] She played Eva, the leader of a cult inspired by NXIVM, and received positive reviews for her character.[164]

Eilish has a soprano vocal range.[170] Avery Stone of Noisey described her vocals as "ethereal",[171] and Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone characterized them as "whispery".[172] Doreen St. Félix of The New Yorker opined that she has a "husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy".[173] Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also "reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become", describing her soprano as "too diminutive for vocal calisthenics", adding that her "playful version of teen-goth angst" and "electro-saturated debut album" captivated a diverse audience.[174] Her music incorporates pop,[175] dark pop,[176] electropop,[176] emo pop,[177] experimental pop,[178] goth-pop,[179] indie pop,[176][180] teen pop,[181] and alt-pop.[176][182][183] Musicologist Jessica Holmes argued that much of Eilish's music concerns her depression.[184]

Eilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting.[185][186] Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music, and also performs in live shows.[187][185] Eilish and Finneas "like to completely make up things and become characters" and "have songs that are really fictional".[186] Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences.[186] They try to write "really interesting and conversational" lyrics: "We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about."[186] Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to "write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own".[188] When he writes with Eilish, he tries "to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.[188]

Eilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience.[189] In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song "Xanny".[190]

Influences
Eilish grew up listening to the Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day,[191] the 1975,[192] Arctic Monkeys, Linkin Park[193] and Lana Del Rey.[194] She has said that stumbling upon Aurora's "Runaway" on YouTube inspired her to pursue a music career.[195] Hip hop is her favorite genre and biggest inspiration.[196]

She has recounted that Matty Healy was an early inspiration for her: "His show is the second show I ever went to in my life. He changed so much about who I am, how I write music."[192][197] She has also cited Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, and Avril Lavigne as major musical and style influences.[198][199] Other influences include Adele,[200] Earl Sweatshirt, James Blake, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls, Lorde, Marina and the Diamonds, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, XXXTentacion, and Twenty One Pilots.[209] She has also shown appreciation for Paramore after inviting Hayley Williams to join her set during Williams's first Coachella set to perform an acoustic version of "Misery Business" and sing "Happier Than Ever".[210] Eilish also named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices after she called fashion her "defense mechanism" during an acceptance speech.[211] She has also credited Damon Albarn for changing the way she views art and music creation.[212]

Eilish has been compared in the media to Lavigne, Lorde and Del Rey,[213][214][215] the last of whom she says she does not want to be compared to, saying, "That woman has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that."[216] Eilish said that Ariana Grande's 2019 album Thank U, Next inspired her to continue making music.[217]

With her win in the same category in 2024 for "What Was I Made For?" from Barbie (2023), she became the youngest person ever to win two Academy Awards in any category and the song became the tenth song in history to win both an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award for Song of the Year, the first song this century to achieve this milestone.[162]

Style
Much of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, oversized clothing.[228][229][39] In 2017, she said she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her.[230] She tries to be "really different from a lot of people" and dresses opposite to what others wear.[186] Aiming to "look memorable", Eilish said that she "proved to people that [she's] more important than they think" and likes being "kind of intimidating, so people will listen up."[186][231][232] In 2019, she said: "Over time it's kind of become a thing, 'Billie Eilish, the creepy, weird, scary girl.' And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing."[233]

In May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body.[234][235] In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go? Tour, she premiered Not My Responsibility, a short film which addresses her experiences of body shaming.[236] Not My Responsibility was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel in May 2020.[237]

Eilish was on the cover of the June 2021 issue of British Vogue. The photoshoot by Craig McDean featured her dressed in lingerie, specifically focused on corsets.[238][239] Eilish made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2021, which had the theme "In America: A Lexicon of Fashion", wearing an Oscar de la Renta gown under the condition that the fashion house would permanently end its use of real fur.[240] Though the dress was inspired by the original Barbie doll, fashion critics observed its likeness to Golden Age star Marilyn Monroe, who wore a tulle de la Renta gown in the early 1950s.[241]

Products and endorsements
In April 2019, Eilish released clothing in collaboration with Takashi Murakami,[242][243] inspired by her music video for "You Should See Me in a Crown", also directed and animated by Murakami, as well as a limited edition vinyl figure of herself from the video.[244] Eilish also collaborated with Adobe Creative Cloud the same month for a series of advertisements[245] as well as a social media art contest, where users would submit artwork with the hashtag "#BILLIExADOBE".[246][247]

Eilish appeared in the debut of Calvin Klein's #MyCalvins ad campaign in May 2019,[248][249] as well as the Ad Council's "Seize the Awkward" campaign, a series of public service announcements targeting mental health awareness.[250][251] She fronted MCM Worldwide's fall 2019 advertising campaign in July 2019,[252] and later that month collaborated with Los Angeles-based clothing brand Freak City on a clothing line.[253][254][255] Also in July 2019, she performed at a dinner hosted by Chanel on Shelter Island to celebrate the brand's pop-up yacht club.[256][257]

In August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song "You Should See Me in a Crown" in Music Lab sessions in its stores.[258] Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills[259][260] was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character Nozomi Tojo from Love Live!, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line.[261] The brand later clarified that Eilish had no knowledge of the plagiarism.[262][263]

In November 2021, she debuted "Eilish", her perfume brand, which is vegan and cruelty-free.[264][265]

Advocacy
Eilish has a history of political activism, publicly expressing her views on a multitude of political issues.[266] She has been vocal with regard to environmental causes, including climate change awareness.[267][268][269] Among other pursuits, Eilish signed an open letter to world leaders urging them to take action against climate-induced poverty,[270] embarked on an ad campaign encouraging young people to use technology for environmental advocacy, and hosted a six-day climate seminar in London titled Overheated to discuss topics such as sustainable fashion and youth activism.[271][272] Her 2019 single "All the Good Girls Go to Hell" and its subsequent video center around climate change and use heaven-and-hell imagery to criticize ignorance of rising sea levels,[273][274] and she permitted the nonprofit CoralWatch to use "Ocean Eyes" as part of an online awareness campaign about Australia's Great Barrier Reef.[275] Eilish was raised as a vegetarian, and became vegan in 2014. She is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and has criticized the dairy,[276] wool,[277] and mink fur industries.[278]

Eilish has spoken in multiple occasions about women's rights.[279][280] A supporter of body positivity, she wrote and produced the 2020 short film Not My Responsibility as a response to body shaming toward her and the double standards placed upon women's appearances.[281][282][283] "Your Power", one of her 2021 singles, criticizes the sexual exploitation of young women, primarily by men who hold power over them.[284][285] Eilish associates herself with the US abortion rights movement; she expressed rage when Texas implemented its anti-abortion laws in 2021.[286][287] During the 2022 Glastonbury festival, she performed "Your Power" to condemn the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She spoke of the decision: "Today is a really, really dark day for women in the U.S. I'm just going to say that as I cannot bear to think about it any longer in this moment."[288] She included a reference to Roe v. Wade's overturning in her 2022 track "TV", much of which she wrote after a draft of the court decision was leaked online in May.[289][290]

In March 2020, Eilish encouraged fans online to register to vote for the 2020 US presidential election.[291] In August 2020, she performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and announced her endorsement of Joe Biden's presidential campaign.[292]

At the 2024 Academy Awards Eilish wore an Artists4Ceasefire pin which calls for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.[293]

Paul Richard Alexander (January 30, 1946 – March 11, 2024) was an American paralytic polio survivor, lawyer and writer. The last man to live in an iron lung, he contracted polio in 1952 at the age of six. Alexander earned a bachelor's degree and Juris Doctor at the University of Texas at Austin, and was admitted to the bar in 1986. He self-published a memoir in 2020.

Biography
Alexander was born on January 30, 1946, in Dallas[1] to Gus Nicholas Alexander, the child of Greek immigrants, and Doris Marie Emmett, of Lebanese descent.[2][3] He contracted polio at the age of six and was paralyzed for life, only able to move his head, neck, and mouth.[4][5][6]

During a major U.S. outbreak of polio in the early 1950s, hundreds of children around Dallas, Texas, including Alexander, were taken to Parkland Hospital. There, children were treated in a ward of iron lungs. He almost died in the hospital before a doctor noticed he was not breathing and rushed him into an iron lung.[7]

He spent eighteen months in the hospital. At discharge, his parents rented a portable generator and a truck to bring him and his iron lung home. Beginning in 1954, with help from the March of Dimes and a physical therapist named Mrs. Sullivan, Alexander taught himself glossopharyngeal breathing, which allowed him to leave the iron lung for gradually increasing periods of time.[8]

Alexander was one of the Dallas Independent School District's first home schooled students. He learned to memorize instead of taking notes. At the age of twenty-one, he graduated second in his class from W. W. Samuell High School in 1967, becoming the first person to graduate from a Dallas high school without physically attending a class.[2][8]

Alexander received a scholarship[4] to Southern Methodist University. He transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1978, then a Juris Doctor in 1984.[9] Before he was admitted to the bar in 1986, he was employed as an instructor of legal terminology to court stenographers at an Austin trade school. He represented clients in court in a three-piece suit and a modified wheelchair that held his body upright.[10][11]

Alexander has been recognized by Guinness World Records as the person who has spent the longest amount of time living in an iron lung.[12]

Alexander started a TikTok account in January 2024, on which he posted videos discussing his life. He had more than 330,000 followers at the time of his death.[2]

Alexander died in Dallas on March 11, 2024, at the age of 78.[1][13] Although he had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in February, the actual cause of death was unclear.[14][13][15] He was one of the last two people still using the technology, alongside Martha Lillard, who first entered an iron lung in 1953.[16]

Book
Alexander self-published his memoir, Three Minutes for a Dog: My Life in an Iron Lung, in April 2020 with the assistance of friend and former nurse Norman D. Brown.[17][18] Alexander spent more than eight years writing the book, using a plastic stick and a pen to tap out on a keyboard or by dictating the words to his friend.[8]

The Academy Awards, commonly known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry. They are presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) in the United States, in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the Academy's voting membership.[1] The Oscars are widely considered to be the most prestigious awards in the film industry.[2]

The major award categories are presented during a live-televised Hollywood ceremony that is typically held in February or March. It is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony.[3] The 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929,[4] the second ceremony in 1930 was the first one broadcast by radio, and the 1953 ceremony was the first one televised.[3] It is also the oldest of the four major annual American entertainment awards; its equivalents – the Emmy Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards.[5] The Oscar statuette depicts a knight rendered in the Art Deco style.[6]

History
The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner function at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people.[7]

The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.[8][3] The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($85 at 2020 prices). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15 minutes.

For this first ceremony, winners were announced to the media three months earlier. For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards.[3] In 1940, the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the following year the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.[3]

The term "Oscar" is a registered trademark of the AMPAS; however, in the Italian language, it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony, regardless of which field.[9][10]

Milestones
The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.[3]

At the 29th ceremony, held in 1957, the Best Foreign Language Film category, now known as Best International Feature Film, was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

Perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage of The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles flashing a peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, "Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?" Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr.

Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.[11]

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[12]

Since 1973 all Academy Awards ceremonies (except for 2021) have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture. Traditionally, the previous year's winners for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively, while the previous year's winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.

On February 9, 2020, Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards.[13]

That same evening, Tom Hanks announced the opening of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, originally slated for December 14, 2020.[14] The museum development started in 2017 under Kerry Brougher, but is now led by Bill Kramer.[15] The industry-curated exhibits are geared toward the history of motion pictures and the art & science of film making, exhibiting trailblazing directors, actors, film-makers, sound editors and more, and the museum houses famous artifacts from acclaimed movies such as Dorothy's Ruby Red Slippers from The Wizard of Oz.

The 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021, was held on April 25, 2021, after it was postponed from its original February 28, 2021, schedule due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema. As with the two previous ceremonies, there was no host. The ceremony was broadcast on ABC. It took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California for the 19th consecutive year, along with satellite location taking place at the Union Station also in Los Angeles.[16] Because of the virus impact on films and TV industries, Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony, streaming movies with a previously planned theatrical release were eligible.[17] The theatrical requirement was reinstated starting with the 95th Academy Awards.[18]

Oscar statuette
Academy Award of Merit
See also: § Awards of Merit categories
The best-known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette.[19] Made of gold-plated bronze on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34.3 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.856 kg), and depicts a knight rendered in Art Deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.[20]

Sculptor George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Cedric Gibbons' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years, the bronze was abandoned in favor of Britannia metal, a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold.[19] Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones.[21] The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award statuettes. From 1983 to 2015,[22] approximately 50 Oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens & Company.[23] It would take between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes.[24] In 2016, the Academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes, handing manufacturing duties to Walden, New York–based Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry, now owned and operated by UAP Urban Art Projects.[25][26] While based on a digital scan of an original 1929 Oscar, the statuettes retain their modern-era dimensions and black pedestal. Cast in liquid bronze from 3D-printed ceramic molds and polished, they are then electroplated in 24-karat gold by Brooklyn, New York–based Epner Technology. The time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months.[27] R.S. Owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the Academy and service existing Oscars that need replating.[28]

Naming
The origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy "Oscar".

Margaret Herrick, librarian and president of the Academy, may have said she named it after her supposed uncle Oscar in 1921.[a] The only corroboration was a 1938 clipping from the Los Angeles Examiner, in which Herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase, "How's your uncle Oscar".[29]

Bette Davis, in her 1962 autobiography, claimed she named it in 1936 after her first husband, Harmon Oscar Nelson, of whom the statue's rear end reminded her.[29][30] But the term had been in use at least two years before, and in a 1974 biography written by Whitney Stine with commentary from Davis, Davis wrote "I relinquish once and for all any claim that I was the one — so, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the honor is all yours".[29][31]

Columnist Sidney Skolsky wrote in his 1970 memoir that he came up with the term in 1934 under pressure for a deadline, mocking Vaudeville comedians who asked "Will you have a cigar, Oscar?" The Academy credits Skolsky with "the first confirmed newspaper reference" to Oscar in his column on March 16, 1934, which was written about that year's 6th Academy Awards.[32] But in the newspaper clipping that Skolsky referred to, he wrote that "these statues are called 'Oscars'", meaning that the name was already in use.[29]

Bruce Davis, a former executive director of the Academy, credited Eleanore Lilleberg, a secretary at the Academy when the award was first introduced, for the nickname. She had overseen the pre-ceremony handling of the awards. Davis credits Lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of Einar Lilleberg, Eleanore's brother, that Einar had referenced a Norwegian army veteran named Oscar that the two knew in Chicago, whom Einar described as having always "stood straight and tall".[29][33] He asserts credit "should almost certainly belong to" Lilleberg.[33]

In 2021, Brazilian researcher Dr. Waldemar Dalenogare Neto found the probable first public mention of the name "Oscar", in journalist Relman Morin's "Cinematters" column in the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record on December 5, 1933. Since the awards didn't take place that year, he said: "What's happened to the annual Academy banquet? As a rule, the banquet and the awarding of "Oscar", the bronze statuette given for best performances, is all over long before this". This information changes the version of Sidney Skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name.[34]

Engraving
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners returned their statuettes to the Academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective Oscars. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. The R.S. Owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony, bearing the name of every potential winner. The nameplates for the non-winning nominees are later recycled.[35][36]

Ownership of Oscar statuettes
Prior to 1950, Oscar statuettes were (and remain) the property of the recipient.[37] Since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.[38]

In 1989, Michael Todd's grandson tried to sell Todd's Best Picture Oscar for his 1956 production of Around the World in 80 Days to a movie prop collector. The Academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale.

In 1992, Harold Russell consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for The Best Years of Our Lives to auction to raise money for his wife's medical expenses. Though his decision caused controversy, the first Oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on August 6, 1992, for $60,500 ($126,200 today). Russell defended his action, saying, "I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't".[39]

In December 2011, Orson Welles' 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.[40] On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542 ($1,120,800 today).[41]

Some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.[38]

Other awards presented by the Academy
See also: § Special categories
In addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):[42]

Governors Awards:
The Academy Honorary Award (annual) (which may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette);
The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (since 1938) (in the form of a bust of Thalberg);
The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (since 1957) (in the form of an Oscar statuette);
The Academy Scientific and Technical Awards:
Academy Award of Merit (non-competitive) (in the form of an Oscar statuette);
Scientific and Engineering Award (in the form of a bronze tablet);
Technical Achievement Award (annual) (in the form of a certificate);
The John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation (since 1978) (in the form of a medal);
The Gordon E. Sawyer Award (since 1982); and
The Academy Student Academy Awards (annual).
The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting.

Nomination
From 2004 to 2020, the Academy Award nomination results were announced to the public in mid-January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February. In 2021, the nominees were announced in March. In 2022, the nominees were announced in early February for the first time since 2003.

Voters
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 9,487 as of 2022.[43][44]

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. As of 2022, actors constitute the largest bloc, numbering 1,359 (14.1% of the voting body).[44] Votes have been certified by the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor Price Waterhouse) since the 7th Academy Awards in 1935.[45][46][47] In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting would be implemented in 2013, replacing mailed paper ballots.[48]

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination, or an existing member may submit a name, based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join.[49]

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the Los Angeles Times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).[50] In 2016, the Academy launched an initiative to expand its membership and increase diversity; by 2022, voting membership stood at 9,487.[44]

Rules
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in Los Angeles County, California, and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best International Feature Film, Best Documentary Feature, and awards in short film categories). Additionally, the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run, with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6 pm and 10 pm local time.[51][52]

For example, the 2009 Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker, was originally first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the 2008 awards, as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the 2009 awards. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the International Feature Film category per year.[53]

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short-subject awards, and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2,048 by 1,080 pixels.[54] Since the 90th Academy Awards, presented in 2018, multi-part and limited series have been ineligible for the Best Documentary Feature award. This followed the win of O.J.: Made in America, an eight-hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on ABC and ESPN, in that category in 2017. The Academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film.[33]

The Best International Feature Film award does not require a U.S. release. It requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection.

The Best Documentary Feature award requires either week-long releases in both Los Angeles County and any of the five boroughs of New York City during the previous calendar year,[b] or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the Documentary Feature Qualifying Festival list (regardless of any public exhibition or distribution), or submission in the International Feature Film category as its country's official selection. The qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non-documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings. Additionally, a film must have been reviewed by a critic from The New York Times, Time Out New York, the Los Angeles Times, or LA Weekly.[56]

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

Awards in short film categories (Best Documentary Short Subject, Best Animated Short Film, and Best Live Action Short Film) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards. First, the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year, instead covering one year starting on October 1, and ending on September 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony. Second, there are multiple methods of qualification. The main method is a week-long theatrical release in either New York City or Los Angeles County during the eligibility period. Films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the Academy, also without regard to prior public distribution. Finally, a film that is selected as a gold, silver, or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous Student Academy Awards is also eligible (Documentary category for that award, and Animation, Narrative, Alternative, or International for the other awards). The requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards. Only one screening per day is required. For the Documentary award, the screening must start between noon and 10 pm local time; for other awards, no specific start time is required, but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times.[56][57]

In late December, ballots, and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees. In all major categories, a variant of the single transferable vote is used, with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees (ten for Best Picture) ranked preferentially.[58][59][60] In certain categories, including International Feature Film, Documentary and Animated Feature, nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches.

In most categories, the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members.[58][60] Since 2009, the Best Picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting.[60][61] Since 2013, re-weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the Best Visual Effects.[62][63]

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in Oscar season. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.[64] For example, a producer of the 2009 Best Picture nominee The Hurt Locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front-runner (The Hurt Locker eventually won).

Academy Screening Room
The Academy Screening Room or Academy Digital Screening Room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the Academy to view all eligible films (except, initially, those in the International category) in one place. It was introduced in 2019, for the 2020 Oscars, though DVD screeners and Academy in-person screenings were still provided. For films to be included on the platform, the North American distributor must pay $12,500, including a watermarking fee, and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the Academy. The platform can be accessed via Apple TV and Roku players.[65][66] The watermarking process involved several video security firms, creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings.[67]

In 2021, for the 2022 Oscars, the Academy banned all physical screeners and in-person screenings, restricting official membership viewing to the Academy Screening Room. Films eligible in the Documentary and International categories were made available in different sections of the platform. Distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform.[68] The in-person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[69] Eligible films do not have to be added to the platform, but the Academy advertises them to voting members when they are.[68]

Awards ceremonies

Telecast

Dolby Theatre, Hollywood, 2009

95th Academy Awards, Dolby Theatre, Hollywood, 2023
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. Black tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow-tie, and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this (the artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).

The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.[70] The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by NBC, which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when ABC took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970. NBC regained the rights for five years (1971–75), then ABC resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.[71] The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.

The ceremonies were moved up from late March/early April to late February, since 2004, to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success coinciding with the NCAA division I men's basketball tournament, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. (In 1976 and 1977, ABC's regained Oscars were moved from Tuesday to Monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on NBC) The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February sweeps period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into the first Sunday of March to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympic Games. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of Passover and Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public.[72] Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. As of 2020, the production of the Academy Awards telecast held the distinction of winning one the highest number of Emmys in history, with 54 wins and 280 nominations overall.[73]

After many years of being held on Mondays at 6:00 p.m. Pacific/9:00 pm Eastern, since the 1999 ceremonies, it was moved to Sundays at 5:30 pm PT/8:30 pm ET.[74] The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.[75] For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.[76] In 2010, the Academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Furthermore, a January ceremony on Sunday would clash with National Football League playoff games.[77] In 2018, the Academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late February to mid-February beginning with the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.[78] In 2024, the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of 4:00 pm PT/7:00 pm ET, the apparent impetus being the ability for ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out program at 7:30 pm PT/10:30 pm ET [79]

Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. On March 30, 1981, the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day, after the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.[80]

In 1993, an In Memoriam segment was introduced,[81] honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.[82] This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a "popularity contest" feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead. This segment was later followed by a commercial break.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15 minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty-three minutes.[83][84] In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced winners' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.[85] In 2016, in a further effort to streamline speeches, winners' dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker.[86] During the 2018 ceremony, host Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become, by announcing that he would give a brand-new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night (a reward won by Mark Bridges when accepting his Best Costume Design award for Phantom Thread).[87] The Wall Street Journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows: 14 on song performances; 25 on the hosts' speeches; 38 on prerecorded clips; and 78 on the awards themselves, broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement, 24 on winners walking to the stage, and 30 on their acceptance speeches.[88]

Although still dominant in ratings, the viewership of the Academy Awards has steadily dropped; the 88th Academy Awards were the lowest-rated in the past eight years (although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership), while the show itself also faced mixed reception. Following the show, Variety reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions.[89] In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.[90]

TV ratings
Historically, the telecast's viewership is higher when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture award. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th Academy Awards in 1998, the year of Titanic, which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of US$600.8 million in the US, a box-office record that would remain unsurpassed for years.[91] The 76th Academy Awards ceremony, in which The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards, including Best Picture, drew 43.56 million viewers.[92] The most-watched ceremony based on Nielsen ratings to date, however, was the 42nd Academy Awards (Best Picture Midnight Cowboy), which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.[93] Hoping to reinvigorate the pre-show and ratings, the 2023 Oscars organizers hired members of the Met Gala creative team.[94]

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings, despite how much critical acclaim those films have received. The 78th Academy Awards, which awarded a low-budget independent film (Crash with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.[95] In 2008, the 80th Academy Awards telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest-rated and least-watched ceremony at the time, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.[96] The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film (this time, the The Coen Brothers's No Country for Old Men).


Academy Awards Viewership 1974–2023, in millions[97][98]
Whereas the 92nd Academy Awards drew an average of 23.6 million viewers,[99] the 93rd Academy Awards drew an even lower viewership of 10.4 million,[100] the lowest viewership recorded by Nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974.[101] The 94th and 95th editions drew 16.6 and 18.7 million viewers, respectively, still below the audience of the 92nd edition.[102][103]

Archive
The Academy Film Archive holds copies of every Academy Awards ceremony since the 1949 Oscars, as well as material on many prior ceremonies, along with ancillary material related to more recent shows. Copies are held in a variety of film, video and digital formats.[104]

Venues
In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard and the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.

Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.[105]

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre, after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Santa Monica, California, in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Downtown Los Angeles, this time to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Music Center. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the ceremony returned to the Shrine Auditorium.

In 2002, Hollywood's Dolby Theatre (previously known as the Kodak Theatre) became the presentation's current venue.[106]

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

In August 2018, the Academy announced that several categories would not be televised live, but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony.[108] Following dissent from Academy members, they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live. This followed several proposals (among them, the introduction of a Popular Film category) that the Academy had announced but did not implement.[109]

Criticism and controversies
Accusations of commercialism
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, many studios spend around 25 million dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the "Oscar season".[117] This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing and lobbying than by quality. William Friedkin, an Academy Award–winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself".[118]

Tim Dirks, editor of AMC's Filmsite, has written of the Academy Awards:

Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking "formula-made" blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.[119]

A recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the Oscar season is the whisper campaign. These campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie. Examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against Zero Dark Thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that Lincoln distorts history.[120]

Accusations of bias
Further information: Oscar bait
Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. in the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. The term "Oscar bait" was coined to describe such movies. This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring "Oscar bait" over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.[121]

Despite the success of The Dark Knight, the film did not receive a Best Picture nomination at the 81st Academy Awards. This decision received substantial criticism and was described as a "snub" by many publications.[122][123][124] The backlash to the decision was such that, for the 82nd Academy Awards awards in 2010, the academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as "The Dark Knight Rule".[125][126][127][124]

Allegations of a lack of diversity
The Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.[128][129][130] This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which show that only 6.4% of academy award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing.[131] Due to a variety of reasons, including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples, a number of high-profile Oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals, as well as performances of Asian characters rewritten for white characters.[132][133] It took until 2023 for an Asian woman to win an Academy Award for Best Actress, when Michelle Yeoh received the award for her performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once. The 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott, popularized on social media with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, based on activists' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.[134] In response, the Academy initiated "historic" changes in membership by 2020.[135][136] Some media critics claim the Academy's efforts to address its purported racial, gender and national biases are merely distractions.[137][138][139][140] By contrast, the Golden Globe Awards already have multiple winners of Asian descent in leading actress categories.[141] Some question whether the Academy's definition of "merit" is just or empowering for non-Americans.[142]

The Academy’s Representation and Inclusion Standards have been criticized for excluding Jews as a distinct underrepresented class.[143]

Miscategorization of actors
See also: Carol (film) § Oscar category
The Academy has no rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting, and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress. This has led situations where a film has two or more co-leads, and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other, and to increase the film's chances of winning. This practice has been derisively called "category fraud". For example, Rooney Mara was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Carol (2015), despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to Cate Blanchett, who was nominated for Best Actress. Another example is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), where Brad Pitt was nominated for and won Best Supporting Actor, even though he played an equally important role to Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio. In both these cases, critics argued that The Weinstein Company, the studio behind the former film, had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co-lead.[144][145]

Symbolism or sentimentalization
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity,[146] to make up for a "snub" for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded, or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.[147]

Recognition of streaming media film
Following the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film Roma had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services. Spielberg had been concerned that Netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical Oscar-winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other Best Picture-nominated films, while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical-run status to qualify for an Oscar.[148]

The United States Department of Justice, having heard of this potential rule change, wrote a letter to the Academy in March 2019, cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti-trust concerns against the Academy.[149] Following its April 2019 board meeting, the Academy Board of Governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for Oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs.[150]

2022 Chris Rock and Will Smith slapping incident
Main article: Chris Rock–Will Smith slapping incident
During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, Chris Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head[151] with a G.I. Jane reference. Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Rock across the face, then returned to his seat and told Rock, twice, to "Keep my wife's name out [of] your fucking mouth!"[152][153][154] While later accepting the Best Actor award for King Richard, Smith apologized to the Academy and the other nominees, but not to Rock.[155][156][157] Rock decided not to press charges against Smith.[158][relevant?]

On April 8, 2022, the Academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson informing the public that Will Smith had received a ten-year ban from attending the Oscars as a result of the incident.[159]

Refusals of the award
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer). Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.[160] Nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later, at the 1938 ceremony. Nichols was nominated for three further Academy Awards during his career.

George C. Scott became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for Patton) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony. Scott described it as a "meat parade", saying, "I don't want any part of it".[161][162][163]

The third person to refuse the award was Marlon Brando, who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's The Godfather), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony, Brando asked actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech in his place, detailing his criticisms, for which there was booing and cheering by the audience.[164][160] In 2022, Littlefeather was accused by her sisters of misrepresenting her ancestry as Native American.[165][166][167][168][169]

Disqualifications
Seven films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony:[170]

The Circus (1928) – The film was voluntarily removed by the Academy from competitive categories, to award Charlie Chaplin a special award.
Hondo (1953) – Removed from the Best Story ballot after letters from the producer and nominee questioned its inclusion in the category.
High Society (1955) – Withdrawn from screenwriting ballot after being mistaken for the 1956 movie of the same title.
The Godfather (1972) – Initially nominated for eleven awards, its nomination for Best Original Score was revoked after it was discovered that its main theme was very similar to music that the score's composer had written for an earlier film. None of its other nominations were revoked, and it received three Oscars, including Best Picture.
A Place in the World (1992) – Removed from the Best Foreign Language Film ballot after it was discovered that the country which submitted the film exercised insufficient artistic control.
Alone Yet Not Alone (2014) – The film's title song, "Alone Yet Not Alone", was removed from the Best Original Song ballot after Bruce Broughton was found to have improperly contacted other members of the academy's musical branch; this was the first time that a film was removed from a ballot for ethical reasons.
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2017) – Sound mixer Greg P. Russell's nomination was rescinded one day before the Awards when it was discovered he had improperly contacted voters by telephone. In this case, the nominations for the other three nominated sound mixers, Gary Summers, Jeffrey J. Haboush and Mac Ruth, were allowed to stand.
One film was disqualified after winning the award, and had the winner return the Oscar:

Young Americans (1969) – Initially won the award for Best Documentary Feature, but was later revoked after it was revealed that it had opened theatrically prior to the eligibility period.
One film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the Oscar:

Tuba Atlantic (2011) – Its nomination for Best Live Action Short Film was revoked when it was discovered that the film had aired on television in 2010, before its theatrical release.
Remarks about animated films as children's genre
At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). While introducing the category, Bailey stated that animated films are "formative experiences as kids who watch them," as James put it, "So many kids watch these movies over and over, over and over again." Scott added: "I see some parents who know exactly what we're talking about."[171] The remarks were heavily criticized by animation fans and those working in the animation industry as infantilizing the medium and perpetuating the stigma that animated works are strictly for children, especially since the industry was credited with sustaining the flow of Hollywood content and revenue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phil Lord, co-producer of one of the nominated films, The Mitchells vs. the Machines, tweeted that it was "super cool to position animation as something that kids watch and adults have to endure." The film's official social media accounts responded to the joke with an image reading: "Animation is cinema."[172][173] A week later, Lord and his producing partner Christopher Miller wrote a guest column in Variety criticizing the academy for the joke and how Hollywood has been treating animation writing that "no one set out to diminish animated films, but it's high time we set out to elevate them." They also suggested to the academy that the category should be presented by a filmmaker who respects the art of animation as cinema.[174]

Adding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast.[175] The winner for the Best Animated Short award was The Windshield Wiper, a multilingual Spanish-American film which is adult animated, while another nominee in three categories: Best Animated Feature, Best Documentary Feature Film, and Best International Feature Film, was Flee, a PG-13 rated animated documentary about an Afghan refugee. Alberto Mielgo, director of The Windshield Wiper, later gave an acceptance speech for the Oscar: "Animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine. Animation for adults is a fact. It's happening. Let's call it cinema. I'm very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation."[176] Some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision to not broadcast the award.[177]

Another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of PG-13 or more, with a few of them —The Triplets of Belleville, Persepolis, Chico and Rita, The Wind Rises, Anomalisa, My Life as a Courgette, The Breadwinner, Loving Vincent, Isle of Dogs, I Lost My Body, and Flee— having been nominated in this category, with The Boy and the Heron being the first adult animated film (in this case, PG-13-rated) to win in the 96th Academy Awards. In addition, a non-Ghibli anime has yet to win.[178][179][180]

These comments came as #NewDeal4Animation, a movement of animation workers demanding equal pay, treatment and recognition alongside their contemporaries working in live-action, was picking up momentum during negotiations for a new contract between The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839/SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,[181] and the presentation is being used to rally the movement.

During the 96th Academy Awards in 2024, host Jimmy Kimmel said, "Please raise your hand if you let your kid fill out this part of the ballot." These remarks would again prompt backlash, with Christopher Miller, producer of that year's nominated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, tweeting out that the joke was "tired and lazy".[182] The PG-13-rated The Boy and the Heron would subsequently win the award.

Associated events
The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards:

Governors Awards, which include the presentation of the Academy Honorary Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award[183]
The 25th Independent Spirit Awards (2010), usually held in Santa Monica, California the Saturday before the Oscars, marked the first time it was moved to a Friday and a change of venue to L.A. Live
The annual "Night Before", traditionally held at the Beverly Hills Hotel, begun in 2002 and generally known as the party of the season, benefits the Motion Picture & Television Fund, which operates a retirement home for SAG actors in the San Fernando Valley
Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party airs the awards live at the nearby Pacific Design Center[184]
The Governors Ball is the Academy's official after-party, including dinner (until 2011), and is adjacent to the awards-presentation venue.[185]
The Vanity Fair after-party, historically at the former Morton's restaurant, has been at the Sunset Tower since 2009.[186]
Presenter and performer gifts
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years, these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners.[187] The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014, the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000.[188] The value has risen to the point where the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.[189] Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, videophones, a four-night stay at a hotel, watches, bracelets, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, weight-loss gummie candy and up to $25,000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from New York City facial plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich.[187][190][191][192][193] Some of the gifts have even had a "risque" element to them; in 2014, the adult products retailer Adam & Eve had a "Secret Room Gifting Suite". Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included Judith Hoag, Carolyn Hennesy, Kate Linder, Chris Mulkey, Jim O'Heir and John Salley.[194]

 Sources conflict on if she actually said this. Deadline puts doubt on it, saying "'He reminds me of my Uncle Oscar,' she was reported to have said, while in the hearing of a 'nearby newspaper columnist' who picked up the anecdote and ran with it the next day". Variety and The Hollywood Reporter state with certainty that she made a claim to the Oscar nickname.
 Starting with the 2017 awards, a qualifying release for the Documentary Feature award can take place anywhere in the five boroughs of New York City. Previously, a New York City qualifying run could only take place in Manhattan. Since then, Brooklyn has also become a popular location.[55]

Akira Toriyama (Japanese: 鳥山明, Hepburn: Toriyama Akira, April 5, 1955 – March 1, 2024[1]) was a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the popular manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball (his most famous work) and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Toriyama came to be regarded as one of the most important authors in the history of manga with his works highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.

He earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended.

His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 260 million copies worldwide,[2][a][c] it is one of the best-selling manga series of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.

Early life
Akira Toriyama was born in the town of Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.[8][9] He had a younger sister.[10] Toriyama drew pictures since a young age, mainly of the animals and vehicles that he was fond of. He related being blown away after seeing One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), and said he was drawn deeper into the world of illustration by hoping to draw pictures that good.[11] He was shocked again in elementary school when he saw the manga collection of a classmate's older brother, and again when he saw a television set for the first time at a neighbor's house.[11] He cited Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy (1952–1968) as the original source for his interest in manga.[12] Toriyama recalled that when he was in elementary school all of his classmates drew imitating anime and manga, as a result of not having many forms of entertainment.[13] He believed that he began to advance above everyone else when he started drawing pictures of his friends.[13] Despite being engrossed with manga in elementary school, Toriyama said he took a break from it in middle school, probably because he became more interested in films and TV shows.[11] When asked if he had any formative experiences with tokusatsu entertainment, Toriyama said he enjoyed the Ultraman TV show and Gamera series of kaiju films.[14]

Toriyama said it was a "no-brainer" that he would attend a high school focused on creative design, but admitted he was more interested in having fun with friends.[11] Although he still did not read much manga, he would draw one himself every once in a while. Despite his parents' strong opposition, Toriyama was confident about going into the work force upon graduation instead of continuing his education.[11] He worked at an advertising agency in Nagoya designing posters for three years.[10] Although Toriyama said he adapted to the job quickly, he admitted that he was often late because he was not a "morning person" and often got reprimanded for dressing casually, until he got sick of the environment and quit.[11]

Career
Early work and Dr. Slump (1978–1983)

In order to seek money after quitting his job at the age of 23, Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, which he had randomly picked up in a coffee shop.[11][15] The timing did not line up for that contest, but another manga magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump, accepted submissions for their Newcomer Award every month. Kazuhiko Torishima, who would become his editor, read and enjoyed Toriyama's manga, but it was not eligible to compete because it was a parody of Star Wars instead of an original work. Torishima sent the artist a telegram and encouraged him to keep drawing and sending him manga.[15][16] This resulted in Wonder Island, which became Toriyama's first published work when it appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1978. It finished last place in the readers survey.[11][15] Toriyama later said that he had planned to quit manga after getting paid, but because Wonder Island 2 (1978) was also a "flop", his stubbornness would not let him and he continued to draw failed stories for a year; claiming around 500 pages' worth, including the published Today's Highlight Island (1979).[11] He said he learned a lot during this year and even had some fun. When Torishima told him to draw a female lead character, Toriyama hesitantly created 1979's Tomato the Cutesy Gumshoe, which had some success. Feeling encouraged, he decided to draw another female lead and created Dr. Slump.[11]

Dr. Slump, which was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1980 to 1984, was a huge success and made Toriyama a household name. It follows the adventures of a perverted professor and his small but super-strong robot Arale.[17] In 1981, Dr. Slump earned Toriyama the Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen or shōjo manga series of the year.[18] An anime adaptation began airing that same year, during the prime time Wednesday 19:00 slot on Fuji TV. Adaptations of Toriyama's work would occupy this time slot continuously for 18 years—through Dr. Slump's original run, Dragon Ball and its two sequels, and finally a rebooted Dr. Slump concluding in 1999. By 2008, the Dr. Slump manga had sold over 35 million copies in Japan.[19]

Although Dr. Slump was popular, Toriyama wanted to end the series within roughly six months of creating it, but publisher Shueisha would only allow him to do so if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after.[20][21] So he worked with Torishima on several one-shots for Weekly Shōnen Jump and the monthly Fresh Jump.[22] In 1981, Toriyama was one of ten artists selected to create a 45-page work for Weekly Shōnen Jump's Reader's Choice contest. His manga Pola & Roid took first place.[11] Toriyama was selected to participate in the contest again in 1982 and submitted Mad Matic.[11] His one-shot Pink was published in the December issue of Fresh Jump.[23] Selected to participate in Weekly Shōnen Jump's Reader's Choice contest for a third time, Toriyama had the bad luck of drawing the first slot and had to work over New Year's on 1983's Chobit. Angry that it was unpopular, he decided to try again and created Chobit 2 (1983).[11]

An official Toriyama fan club, Akira Toriyama Hozonkai (鳥山明保存会, "Akira Toriyama Preservation Society"), was established in 1982. Its newsletters were called Bird Land Press and were sent to members until the club closed in 1987.[24] Toriyama founded Bird Studio in the early 1980s,[25] which is a play on his name; "tori" (鳥) meaning "bird". He began employing an assistant, mostly to work on backgrounds.

Dragon Ball and international success (1983–1997)

Torishima suggested that, as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu shōnen manga.[26] This led to the two-part Dragon Boy, published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump.[23] It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon Boy was well-received and evolved to become the serial Dragon Ball in 1984.[20][27] But before that, The Adventure of Tongpoo was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump's 52nd issue of 1983 and also contained elements that would be included in Dragon Ball.[23]

Serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995 and having sold 159.5 million tankōbon copies in Japan alone,[28] Dragon Ball is one of the best-selling manga series of all time.[29] It began as an adventure/gag manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the "most influential shōnen manga".[17] Dragon Ball was one of the main reasons for the magazine's circulation hitting a record high of 6.53 million copies (1995).[30][31] At the series' end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone involved to let him end the manga, so he could "take some new steps in life".[32] During that near-11-year period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led to five anime adaptations, several animated films, numerous video games, and mega-merchandise. Aside from its popularity in Japan, Dragon Ball was successful internationally as well, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with 300–350 million copies of the manga sold worldwide.

While Toriyama was serializing Dragon Ball weekly, he continued to create the occasional one-shot manga. In 1986, Mr. Ho was published in the 49th issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump.[23] The following year saw publication of Young Master Ken'nosuke, which had a Japanese jidaigeki setting.[23] Toriyama published two Weekly Shōnen Jump one-shots in 1988; The Elder and Little Mamejiro.[23] Karamaru and the Perfect Day followed in issue #13 of 1989.[23]

Also during Dragon Ball's serialization, Torishima recruited him to work as character designer for the 1986 role-playing video game Dragon Quest. The artist admitted he was pulled into it without even knowing what an RPG was and that it made his already busy schedule even more hectic, but he was happy to have been a part after enjoying the finished game.[21] Toriyama continued to work on every installment in the Dragon Quest series until his death. He also served as the character designer for the Super Famicom RPG Chrono Trigger (1995) and for the fighting games Tobal No. 1 (1996) and Tobal 2 (1997) for the PlayStation.[33]

The September 23, 1988, festival film Kosuke & Rikimaru: The Dragon of Konpei Island marked the first time Toriyama made substantial contributions to an animation. He came up with the original story idea, co-wrote the screenplay with its director Toyoo Ashida, and designed the characters.[34] It was screened at the Jump Anime Carnival, which was held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Weekly Shōnen Jump.[35]

Short stories and other projects (1996–2011)
A third anime adaptation based on Dragon Ball, entitled Dragon Ball GT, began airing in 1996, though this was not based on Toriyama's manga directly. He was involved in some overarching elements, including the name of the series and designs for the main cast.[36] Toriyama continued drawing manga in this period, predominantly one-shots and short (100–200-page) pieces, including Cowa! (1997–1998), Kajika (1998), and Sand Land (2000). On December 6, 2002, Toriyama made his only promotional appearance in the United States at the launch of Weekly Shōnen Jump's North American counterpart, Shonen Jump, in New York City.[37] Toriyama's Dragon Ball and Sand Land were published in the magazine in the first issue, which also included an in-depth interview with him.[38]

On March 27, 2005, CQ Motors began selling an electric car designed by Toriyama.[39] The one-person QVOLT is part of the company's Choro-Q series of small electric cars, with only 9 being produced. It cost 1,990,000 yen (about $19,000 US), has a top speed of 30 km/h (19 mph) and was available in five colors.[39] Toriyama stated that the car took over a year to design, "but due to my genius mini-model construction skills, I finally arrived at the end of what was a very emotional journey."[39]

He worked on a 2006 one-shot called Cross Epoch, in cooperation with One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda. The story is a short crossover that presents characters from both Dragon Ball and One Piece. Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 Mistwalker Xbox 360 exclusive RPG Blue Dragon, working with Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, both of whom he had previously worked with on Chrono Trigger.[40] At the time, Toriyama felt the 2007 Blue Dragon anime might potentially be his final work in animation.[41]

In 2008, he collaborated with Masakazu Katsura, his good friend and creator of I"s and Zetman, for the Jump SQ one-shot Sachie-chan Good!!.[42][43] It was later published in North America in the free SJ Alpha Yearbook 2013, which was mailed out to annual subscribers of the digital manga magazine Shonen Jump Alpha in December 2012. The two worked together again in 2009, for the three-chapter one-shot Jiya in Weekly Young Jump.[44]

Toriyama was engaged by 20th Century Fox as a creative consultant on Dragonball Evolution, an American live-action film adaptation of Dragon Ball.[45] He was also credited as an executive producer on the 2009 film, which failed both critically and financially. Toriyama later stated in 2013 that he had felt the script did not "capture the world or the characteristics" of his series and was "bland" and not interesting, so he cautioned them and gave suggestions for changes. But the Hollywood producers did not heed his advice, "And just as I thought, the result was a movie I cannot call Dragon Ball."[46][47] Avex Trax commissioned Toriyama to draw a portrait of pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, and it was printed on the CD of her 2009 single "Rule", which was used as the theme song to the film.[48]

Toriyama drew a 2009 manga titled Delicious Island's Mr. U for Anjō's Rural Society Project, a nonprofit environmental organization that teaches the importance of agriculture and nature to young children.[49] They originally asked him to do the illustrations for a pamphlet, but Toriyama liked the project and decided to expand it into a story. It is included in a booklet about environmental awareness that is distributed by the Anjō city government.[49] As part of Weekly Shōnen Jump's "Top of the Super Legend" project, a series of six one-shots by famed Jump artists, Toriyama created Kintoki for its November 15, 2010, issue.[50] He collaborated with Weekly Shōnen Jump to create a video to raise awareness and support for those affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.[51]

Return to Dragon Ball (2012–2024)
In 2012, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods was announced to be in development, with Toriyama involved in its creation. The film marked the series' first theatrical film in 17 years, and the first time Toriyama had been involved in one as early as the screenwriting stages.[52] The film opened on March 30, 2013. A special "dual ticket" that could be used to see both Battle of Gods and One Piece Film: Z was created with new art by both Toriyama and Eiichiro Oda.[53]

On March 27, 2013, the "Akira Toriyama: The World of Dragon Ball" exhibit opened at the Takashimaya department store in Nihonbashi, garnering 72,000 visitors in its first nineteen days.[54][55] The exhibit was separated into seven areas. The first provided a look at the series' history, the second showed the 400-plus characters from the series, the third displayed Toriyama's manga manuscripts from memorable scenes, the fourth showed special color illustrations, the fifth displayed rare Dragon Ball-related materials, the sixth included design sketches and animation cels from the anime, and the seventh screened Dragon Ball-related videos.[54] It was there until April 15, when it moved to Osaka from April 17 to 23, and ended in Toriyama's native Nagoya from July 27 to September 1.[54]

To celebrate the 45th anniversary of Weekly Shōnen Jump, Toriyama launched a new manga series in its July 13, 2013, issue titled Jaco the Galactic Patrolman.[56] Viz Media began serializing it in English in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, beginning just two days later.[57] The final chapter reveals that the story is set before the events of Dragon Ball and features some of its characters. It would become the final manga that Toriyama wrote and illustrated himself.

The follow-up film to Battle of Gods, Resurrection 'F', released on April 18, 2015, features even more contributions from Toriyama, who personally wrote its original script.[58] Toriyama provided the basic story outline and some character designs for Dragon Ball Super, which began serialization in V Jump in June 2015 with an anime counterpart following in July. Although the anime ended in 2018, he continued to provide story ideas for the manga while Toyotarou illustrated it.[59] Dragon Ball Super: Broly, released in theaters on December 14, 2018, and Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, released on June 11, 2022, continued Toriyama's deep involvement with the films.[60][61]

In January 2024, a logo Toriyama designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his hometown of Kiyosu was unveiled.[62] Toriyama created a new story arc for the 2024 original net animation adaptation of his manga Sand Land.[63] He also created the story and character designs for the upcoming Dragon Ball Daima anime series.[64]

Personal life
Toriyama married Yoshimi Katō (加藤由美) on May 2, 1982.[65][66] She is a former manga artist from Nagoya under the pen name "Nachi Mikami" (みかみなち),[67] and occasionally helped Toriyama and his assistant on Dr. Slump when they were short on time.[68] They had two children: a son named Sasuke (佐助) born on March 23, 1987,[69] and a daughter named Kikka born in October 1990.[70][71] Toriyama lived in his home studio in Kiyosu.[25][72] He was a well-known recluse, who avoided appearing in public or media.[73][74][75] In an extension to his shyness, Toriyama had used an avatar called "Robotoriyama" since December 1980 to represent himself in manga and interviews.[76]

Toriyama had a love of cars and motorcycles, something he inherited from his father who used to race motorbikes and operated an auto repair business for a brief time, although he did not understand the mechanics himself.[77] The author was an animal lover, having kept many different species of birds, dogs, cats, fish, lizards, and bugs as pets since childhood.[77] Some were used as models for characters he created such as Karin and Beerus. Toriyama had a lifelong passion for plastic models,[77] and designed several for the Fine Molds brand. He also collected autographs of famous manga artists, having over 30 including Yudetamago and Hisashi Eguchi, a hobby he gave to the character Peasuke Soramame.[10][78]

Death
On March 1, 2024, Toriyama died of an acute subdural hematoma, at the age of 68. A funeral was held privately with only his family in attendance.[79][80] His death was announced by his production company Bird Studio one week later on March 8.[81] According to sources close to Toriyama, he had planned to undergo surgery for a brain tumor in February 2024.[82] The news of his death caused an outpouring of grief among admirers of his works, who took to social media to express their condolences and celebrate his legacy.[83][84] On Twitter, the trending topics of Akira Toriyama and Dragon Ball surpassed United States President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, which was held at the same time the news of Toriyama's death was announced.[85] Tributes to the artist were given by One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda, Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto, Bleach creator Tite Kubo, My Hero Academia creator Kōhei Horikoshi, Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter creator Yoshihiro Togashi, Video Girl Ai creator Masakazu Katsura, and video game designer Yuji Horii, who worked with Toriyama on Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger.[86][87] In Tokyo, fans publicly mourned while visiting a life-sized statue of Dragon Ball protagonist Goku located outside the headquarters of toy manufacturer Bandai.[88][89] Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi credited Toriyama and his work with playing an "extremely important role in demonstrating Japan's soft power" around the world.[90]

International response
French President Emmanuel Macron shared a photo of an autographed illustration Toriyama gave him as a gift and paid tribute to him and his fans on social media.[91] French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal also paid tribute and stated not even "the [Dragon Balls] and Shenron" could revive him.[92] The foreign ministries of China and El Salvador issued statements of condolences over Toriyama's death.[93][94] Justin Chatwin, who portrayed Goku in the live-action film Dragonball Evolution, apologized for the quality of the film by posting on his Instagram story, "sorry we messed up that adaptation so badly".[95] Several Mexican voice actors who dubbed Dragon Ball characters in Spanish for Latin America also lamented Toriyama's death via social media.[96] A large gathering was held at the Plaza de la Constitución in Mexico City, where hundreds of fans did the Genki-dama hand motion (arms up, palm facing the zenith, pooling energy together) to honor the artist.[97] During the 18th Seiyu Awards on March 9, a moment of silence was held for Toriyama and voice actress Tarako, who died on March 4, in recognition of their contributions to the anime industry.[98] On March 10, in Argentina, thousands of fans went to The Obelisco to remember Toriyama.[99]

Style
Toriyama admired Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy and was impressed by Walt Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians, which he remembered for its high-quality animation.[16][100] He was a fan of Hong Kong martial arts films, especially Bruce Lee films such as Enter the Dragon (1973) and Jackie Chan films such as Drunken Master (1978), which went on to have a large influence on his later work.[101][102][103] He also cited the science fiction films Alien (1979) and Galaxy Quest (1999) as influences.[104] Toriyama stated he was influenced by animator Toyoo Ashida and the anime television series adaptation of his own Dragon Ball, from which he learned that separating colors instead of blending them makes the art cleaner and coloring illustrations easier.[100]

It was Toriyama's sound effects in Mysterious Rain Jack that caught the eye of Kazuhiko Torishima, who explained that usually they are written in katakana, but Toriyama used the Roman alphabet, which he found refreshing.[105] Torishima has stated that Toriyama aimed to be a gag manga artist because the competitions that he submitted to early on required entries in the gag category to only be 15 pages long, compared to story manga entries which had to be 31.[15] In his opinion, Toriyama excelled in black and white, utilizing black areas as a result of not having had the money to buy screentone when he started drawing manga.[105] He also described Toriyama as a master of convenience and "sloppy, but in a good way." For instance, in Dragon Ball, destroying scenery in the environment and giving Super Saiyans blond hair were done in order to have less work in drawing and inking. Torishima claimed that Toriyama drew what he found interesting and was not mindful of what his readers thought,[106] nor did he get much inspiration from other comics, as he chose not to re-read previous works or read manga made by other artists, a practice that Torishima supported.[107] Furthermore, the book A History of Modern Manga (2023) describes Toriyama as "a perfectionist at heart" who "didn't hesitate to redraw entire panels under the worried eye of his editor at Jump".[108]

Dr. Slump is mainly a comedy series, filled with puns, toilet humor, and sexual innuendos. But it also contained many science fiction elements: aliens, anthropomorphic characters, time travel, and parodies of works such as Godzilla, Star Wars, and Star Trek.[17] Toriyama also included many real-life people in the series, such as his assistants, wife, and colleagues (such as Masakazu Katsura), but most notably his editor Kazuhiko Torishima as the series' main antagonist, Dr. Mashirito.[17][109] A running gag in Dr. Slump that utilizes feces has been reported as an inspiration for the Pile of Poo emoji.[110][111]

When Dragon Ball began, it was loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West,[27][112] with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Tang Sanzang. It was also inspired by Hong Kong martial arts films,[113] particularly those of Jackie Chan,[114] and was set in a fictional world based on Asia, taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Central Asian, Arabic, and Indonesian cultures.[17][115] Toriyama continued to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but over the course of serialization this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a "nearly-pure fighting manga" later on.[17] He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of.[17]

Toriyama was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters for the first Dragon Quest video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time.[116] He worked on every installment in the series until he passed away. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work.[117][118] Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, as long as they have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga.[119] Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for Dragon Quest VIII, the boats and ships.[118] In 2016, Toriyama revealed that because of the series' established time period and setting, his artistic options are limited, which makes every iteration harder to design for than the last.[74] The series' Slime character, which has become a mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.[120]

Manga critic Jason Thompson declared Toriyama's art influential, saying that his "extremely personal and recognizable style" was a reason for Dragon Ball's popularity.[17] He points out that the popular shōnen manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had "manly" heroes, such as City Hunter and Fist of the North Star, whereas Dragon Ball starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day.[17] Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures.[121] Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that Dragon Ball is "an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist."[17] James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually "lose the rounded, innocent look that [Toriyama] established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity."[122]

Legacy and accolades
The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers.

 —Akira Toriyama, 2013[123]

Patrick St. Michel of The Japan Times compared Toriyama to animator Walt Disney and Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee, "All three of these individuals, Toriyama included, had a personal artistic style that has become the shorthand for their respective media."[124] Speaking of Dragon Ball, David Brothers of ComicsAlliance wrote that: "Like Osamu Tezuka and Jack Kirby before him, Toriyama created a story with his own two hands that seeped deep into the hearts of his readers, creating a love for both the cast and the medium at the same time."[125] Thompson stated in 2011 that "Dragon Ball is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every Shōnen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways."[17] Patrick W. Galbraith, an associate professor at the School of International Communication at Senshu University, similarly said, "One can sense the DNA of Toriyama's work in all subsequent shōnen releases."[124]

In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on Dragon Ball's global success, Toriyama admitted, "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy."[123] He had previously stated in 2010, "The truth is, I didn't like being a manga artist very much. It wasn't until relatively recently that I realized it's a wonderful job."[104] Many artists have named Toriyama and Dragon Ball as influences, including One Piece author Eiichiro Oda,[126] Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto,[127] Fairy Tail and Rave author Hiro Mashima,[128] Boruto: Naruto Next Generations illustrator Mikio Ikemoto,[129] Venus Versus Virus author Atsushi Suzumi,[130] Bleach creator Tite Kubo, Black Cat author Kentaro Yabuki, and Mr. Fullswing author Shinya Suzuki.[131] German comic book artist Hans Steinbach was strongly influenced by Toriyama,[132] and Thai cartoonist Wisut Ponnimit cited Toriyama as one of his favorite cartoonists.[133] St. Michel wrote that the impact Toriyama and Dragon Ball had extends beyond inspiring newer artists, "he influenced the style of anime as a whole and revealed new economic potential, as the comic series mutated into an anime, video games and infinite merchandise."[124] Ian Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series Steven Universe, is a fan of both Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as reference for his own. He also stated that "We're all big Toriyama fans on [Steven Universe], which kind of shows a bit."[134] French director Pierre Perifel cited Toriyama and Dragon Ball as influences on his DreamWorks Animation film The Bad Guys.[135]

In 2008, Oricon conducted a poll of people's favorite manga artists, with Toriyama coming in second, behind only Nana author Ai Yazawa. He was number one among male respondents and among those over 30 years of age.[136] They held a poll on the Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga in 2010, mangaka being the Japanese word for a manga artist. Toriyama came in second, after only Osamu Tezuka, due to his works being highly influential and popular worldwide.[137] Toriyama won the Special 40th Anniversary Festival Award at the 2013 Angoulême International Comics Festival, honoring his years in cartooning.[138][139] He actually received the most votes for the festival's Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême award that year, though the selection committee chose Willem as the recipient.[140] In a 2014 NTT Docomo poll for the manga artist that best represents Japan, Toriyama came in third place.[141] That same year, entomologist Enio B. Cano named a new species of beetle, Ogyges toriyamai, after Toriyama, and another, Ogyges mutenroshii, after the Dragon Ball character Muten Roshi.[142] Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier or "Knight" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government on May 30, 2019, for his contributions to the arts.[73][143] He was also a 2019 nominee for entry into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.[144] Toriyama was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 Tokyo Anime Awards Festival.[145] Due to his video game design work, IGN named Toriyama number 74 on their list of the Top 100 Game Creators of All Time.[33]

Works
Main article: List of works by Akira Toriyama
Besides Dr. Slump (1980–1984) and Dragon Ball (1984–1995), Toriyama predominantly drew one-shot manga and short (100–200-page) pieces, including Pink (1982), Go! Go! Ackman (1993–1994), Cowa! (1997–1998), Kajika (1998), Sand Land (2000) and Jaco the Galactic Patrolman (2013). Many of his one-shots were collected in his three-volume anthology series, Akira Toriyama's Manga Theater (1983–1997). He also collaborated with other manga artists, such as Katsura and Oda,[146][147] to produce one-shots and crossover shorts.

Toriyama also created many character designs for various video games such as the Dragon Quest series (1986–2023), Chrono Trigger (1995), Blue Dragon (2006), and some Dragon Ball video games. He also designed several characters and mascots for various manga magazines property of Shueisha, his career-long employer and Japan's largest publishing company.[148][149][150]

Besides manga-related works, Toriyama also created various illustrations, album and book covers, mascots and logos.[151][152][153] For example, he sketched several versions of the Dragon Ball Z logo, which Toei Animation then refined into a definitive design.[154]

 2023–24 UEFA Champions League
The UEFA Champions League (previously known as the European Cup, abbreviated as UCL, or sometimes, UEFA CL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.

Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] It has since been expanded, and while most of Europe's national leagues can still only enter their champion, the strongest leagues now provide up to four teams.[2][3] Clubs that finish next-in-line in their national league, having not qualified for the Champions League, are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Europa Conference League.[4]

In its present format, the Champions League begins in late June with a preliminary round, three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The six surviving teams enter the group stage, joining 26 teams qualified in advance. The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system. The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[5] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.[6][7]

Spanish clubs have the highest number of victories (19 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the largest number of winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs, 13 of which have won it more than once, and eight successfully defended their title.[8] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 14 times, and the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions) and also five of the last ten.[9] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[10] Manchester City are the current European champions, having beaten Inter Milan 1–0 in the 2023 final for their first title.

The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Hearts 5–3.[11] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[12] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the "club championship of the continent" by the local newspapers.[13][14]

The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[15] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[16] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[16] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[17]

After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[18] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[19] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[20] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers "Champions of the World" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1]

1955–1967: Beginnings

Alfredo Di Stéfano (pictured in 1959) led Real Madrid to five consecutive European Cup titles between 1956 and 1960.
The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[21][22] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Stade de Reims (France), and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[21][22]

The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[21][22] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[21][22] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[21][22][23] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[21][22][23] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[24][25] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[23][24][25] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[26][27] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[23][26][27]

In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[23][28][29] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[17][30][31] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 in Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[23][30][31] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[8]

Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[32][33] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at Wankdorf Stadium.[32][33][34] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[34][35][36] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at the Wembley Stadium gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[37][38][39]

Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 in the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[40][41][42] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[43][44][45] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[46][47] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the "Lisbon Lions".[48]

1968–1982

Johan Cruyff (pictured in 1972) won the European Cup three times in a row with Ajax.
The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[49] This final came 10 years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[50] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[51]

The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[52] before beating Celtic in the final.[53] In the 1970–71 season Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[54] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[55] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[56] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[57]

The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982.

1982–1992: English dominance is broken
In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster.

Anthem
Main article: UEFA Champions League Anthem
"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away."

—Zinedine Zidane[58]


The two teams line up for the UEFA Champions League Anthem before each match and a flag of the Champions League "starball" logo is waved in the centre circle.
The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as "Champions League", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[59][60] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[59] Stating that "the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy", UEFA's official website adds it is "known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter".[59]

The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[61] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[62] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[63] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[61]

Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012), and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley Stadium, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[64][65] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[66] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[67]

Branding

The "starball" logo is incorporated into the design of the competition's official match ball, the Adidas Finale.
In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, "house colours" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the "starball". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[68] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, "Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, "the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans".[69]

The UEFA Champions League begins with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams, which since the 2009–10 season is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second or third in their national championship.

The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.

Four of the remaining six qualifying places are granted to the winners of a six-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between 10 and 11 clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second or third in their respective national league.

In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements.

In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by FC Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[70]

Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds.

An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[71] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[72] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[73] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[73]

In May 2013,[74] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[75]

In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[76] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[77]

In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the English Premier League as the "4th Place Trophy". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said "The first trophy is to finish in the top four".[78] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: "For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League..."[79]

Group stage and knockout phase

AC Milan and Real Madrid are two of the competition's most successful teams.
The tournament proper begins with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[80] The draw to determine which teams go into each group is seeded based on teams' performance in UEFA competitions, and no group may contain more than one club from each nation. Each team plays six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[80] The winning team and the runners-up from each group then progress to the next round. The third-placed team enters the UEFA Europa League.

For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group plays against the runners-up from another group, and teams from the same association may not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw is entirely random, without association protection.[81]

The group stage is played from September to December, whilst the knock-out stage starts in February. The knock-out ties are played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. The final is typically held in the last two weeks of May, or in the early days of June, which has happened in three consecutive odd-numbered years since 2015. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August.[82]

If the Champions League title holders qualify for the group stage via their domestic league, the champions of association 11 enters the group stage, and champions of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds are also promoted accordingly.
If the Europa League title holders qualify for the group stage via their domestic league, the third-placed team of association 5 enter the group stage, and runners-up of the highest-ranked associations in the second qualifying round are also promoted accordingly.
If the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the qualifying rounds via their domestic league, their spot in the qualifying rounds is vacated, and teams of the highest-ranked associations in earlier rounds are promoted accordingly.
An association may have a maximum of five teams in the Champions League.[83] Therefore, if both the Champions League and Europa League title holders come from the same top-four association and finish outside of the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of the league will not compete in the Champions League and will instead compete in the Europa League.

Prizes
Trophy and medals
Main article: European Champion Clubs' Cup

The trophy
Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86]

The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs.

As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88]

Prize money
As of 2021–22, the fixed amount of prize money paid to participating clubs is as follows.[89]

Play-off round: €5,000,000
Base fee for group stage: €15,640,000
Group match victory: €2,800,000
Group match draw: €900,000
Round of 16: €9,600,000
Quarter-finals: €10,600,000
Semi-finals: €12,500,000
Runners-up: €15,500,000
Champions: €20,000,000
This means that, at best, a club can earn €85,140,000 of prize money under this structure, not counting shares of the qualifying rounds, play-off round or the market pool.

A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the "market pool", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90]

Sponsorship

Real Madrid were barred from wearing their bwin-sponsored jerseys when they played against Galatasaray in Turkey in April 2013, where gambling advertisements are banned.
Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91]

From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knock-out participant stadiums, including the final stage. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021 the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific region along with the global sponsors.[93][94]

The tournament's primary sponsors for the 2021–24 cycle are:

FedEx[95]
Heineken N.V.[96]
Just Eat Takeaway[97]
Mastercard[98]
Oppo[99]
PepsiCo[100]
Sony PlayStation[101]
Turkish Airlines[102]
Expedia (United States only)[103]
Engelbert Strauss (United States Only)[104]
Socios.com (United States only)[105]
Nissan (Japan only)[106]
Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball—the Adidas Finale—and Macron supplies the referees' kit.[107] Hublot is also a secondary sponsor as the official fourth official board of the competition.[108]

Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[109] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[110]

If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[111]

Media coverage

The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[112] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[113]

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.

Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation. Tidal locking has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.

Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.[23]

Etymology
The Modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe.[24] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō. In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð ("Earth"), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[25]

Historically, "Earth" has been written in lowercase. Beginning with the use of Early Middle English, its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as "the earth". By the era of Early Modern English, capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though "earth" and forms with "the earth" remain common.[24] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the more common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name, such as a description of the "Earth's atmosphere", but employs the lowercase when it is preceded by "the", such as "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"[26]

The name Terra /ˈtɛrə/ occasionally is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[27] while in poetry Tellus /ˈtɛləs/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[28] Terra is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages, languages that evolved from Latin, like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings, like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre. The Latinate form Gæa or Gaea (English: /ˈdʒiː.ə/) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (Γαῖα; Ancient Greek: [ɡâi̯.a] or [ɡâj.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /ˈɡaɪ.ə/ rather than the more classical English /ˈɡeɪ.ə/.[29]

There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. The word "earthly" is derived from "Earth". From the Latin Terra comes terran /ˈtɛrən/,[30] terrestrial /təˈrɛstriəl/,[31] and (via French) terrene /təˈriːn/,[32] and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian /tɛˈlʊəriən/[33] and telluric.[34]

A 2012 artistic impression of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk from which Earth and other Solar System bodies were formed
The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002
−0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[35] By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[36] The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.[37]

Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger.[38] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[39] It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[40][41] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[42]

After formation
Main article: Geological history of Earth
Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[43] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[44] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[45] In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[46] By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[47]

As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust.[49] The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after Earth's formation.[50] There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance:[51] (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day,[52] which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists,[53][54] which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.[55]

New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600–540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.[56]

The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma,[57] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma.[58] High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[59] The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the "last ice age", covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.[60]

Origin of life and evolution
Main articles: Origin of life, Earliest known life forms, and History of life
Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[61] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[62] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[63] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[64] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[65] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[66] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[67][68] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[69][70]


An artist's impression of the Archean, the eon after Earth's formation, featuring round stromatolites, which are early oxygen-producing forms of life from billions of years ago. After the Late Heavy Bombardment, Earth's crust had cooled, its water-rich barren surface is marked by continents and volcanoes, with the Moon still orbiting Earth half as far as it is today, appearing 2.8 times larger and producing strong tides.[71]
During the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539 Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[72][73] Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones.[74] Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape species gained the ability to stand upright.[75][better source needed] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[76]

Conjectured illustration of the scorched Earth after the Sun has entered the red giant phase, about 5–7 billion years from now
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[77] Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years.[78][79] The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[80] Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years.[81] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[81][82]

The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius.[77][83] Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[77]

Earth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium,[84] with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometers (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.[85]

Due to Earth's rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its Equator; its diameter is 43 kilometers (27 mi) longer there than at its poles.[86][87] Earth's shape furthermore has local topographic variations. Though the largest local variations, like the Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet below local sea level),[88] only shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 meters or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by only 0.14%.[n 6][90] Since Earth's surface is farthest out from Earth's center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi) is its farthest point out.[91][92] Parallel to the rigid land topography the Ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.[93]

To measure the local variation of Earth's topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a shape called a geoid. Such a geoid shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but gravitational irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level (MSL) as a reference level for topographic measurements.[94]

Relief of Earth's crust
Earth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, it has an area of about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi).[12] Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.

Most of Earth's surface is ocean water: 70.8% or 361 million km2 (139 million sq mi).[95] This vast pool of salty water is often called the world ocean,[96][97] and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world[98][99] or ocean world.[100][101] Indeed, in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely.[102] The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust, but to a lesser extent with shelf seas also shelves of the continental crust. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes,[86] oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.

At Earth's polar regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming polar ice caps.

Earth's land covers 29.2%, or 149 million km2 (58 million sq mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass).[103][104][105] These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).[106]

Land can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation,[107] but ice sheets (10%,[108] not including the equally large land under permafrost)[109] or cold as well as hot deserts (33%)[110] occupy also considerable amounts of it.

The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[111][112] Earth has an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.[113]

The land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth's crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's lithosphere. Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks.[114] Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust.[115]

Earth's surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth's land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4 km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level.

Earth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil.[116][117]

Tectonic plates

Earth's major plates, which are:[118]
  Pacific Plate  African Plate[n 7]  North American Plate  Eurasian Plate  Antarctic Plate  Indo-Australian Plate  South American Plate
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur.[119] The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[120]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old.[121][122] By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma,[123] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.[50]

The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year)[124] and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69 mm/a (2.0–2.7 in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year).[125]

5100–6378	Inner core	12.8–13.1
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity.[128] The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.[129]

Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.[130] Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed.[131] The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth. Density increases with depth, as described in the table on the right.

Among the Solar System's planetary-sized objects Earth is the object with the highest density.

Chemical composition
See also: Abundance of elements on Earth
Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[132][49] The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.[133][132]

Internal heat
Main article: Earth's internal heat budget

A map of heat flow from Earth's interior to the surface of Earth's crust, mostly along the oceanic ridges
The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232.[134] At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F),[135] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi).[136] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.[137][138]

The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m−2, for a global heat loss of 4.42×1013 W.[139] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts.[140] More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.[141]

Gravitational field
Main article: Gravity of Earth
The gravity of Earth is the acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within Earth. Near Earth's surface, gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). Local differences in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's gravitational field, known as gravity anomalies.[142]

Magnetic field
Main article: Earth's magnetic field
Diagram showing the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetosphere. The lines are swept back in the anti-solar direction under the influence of the solar wind.
A schematic view of Earth's magnetosphere with solar wind flowing from left to right
The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a dynamo process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century (although it still remains stronger than its long time average).[143] The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.[144][145]

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.[146] Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.[147] Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates.[148][149] The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,[150] and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.[151][152]

During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.[153]

Orbit and rotation
Rotation
Main article: Earth's rotation

Satellite time lapse imagery of Earth's rotation showing axis tilt
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).[154] Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.[155][156]

Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[2][n 10] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s).[2] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.[157]

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.[158][159]

Orbit
Main articles: Earth's orbit and Earth's location

Exaggerated illustration of Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, marking that the orbital extreme points (apoapsis and periapsis) are not the same as the four seasonal extreme points, the equinox and solstice
Earth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and part of the inner Solar System. Earth's average orbital distance is about 150 million km (93 million mi), which is the basis for the Astronomical Unit and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's distance to the Moon.

Earth orbits the Sun every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. With an apparent movement of the Sun in Earth's sky at a rate of about 1°/day eastward, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian.

The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.[3]

The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.[3][160]

The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius.[161][n 11] This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.[161] Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.[162]

Axial tilt and seasons
Main article: Axial tilt § Earth

Earth's axial tilt causing different angles of seasonal illumination at different orbital positions around the Sun
The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281°[2] with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere.

During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.[163] Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.[164][165]

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.[166]

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years.[167] The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.[168]

In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.[169][n 12] Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.[170]

Earth and the Moon as seen from Mars by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

View of Earth from the Moon by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto.[171][172] The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.[173] The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.[40]

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth.[174] The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.[175] As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases.[176] Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes.[177] During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620 Ma) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.[178]

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.[179] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.[180][181]

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.[159] This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.[182]

On 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[183][184]

Asteroids and artificial satellites

A computer-generated image mapping the prevalence of artificial satellites and space debris around Earth in geosynchronous and low Earth orbit
Earth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa.[185][186] A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun.[187] The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.[188]

As of September 2021, there are 4,550 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth.[189] There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris.[n 13] Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.[190]

Hydrosphere
Main article: Hydrosphere

A view of Earth with its global ocean and cloud cover, which dominate Earth's surface and hydrosphere; at Earth's polar regions, its hydrosphere forms larger areas of ice cover.
Earth's hydrosphere is the sum of Earth's water and its distribution. Most of Earth's hydrosphere consists of Earth's global ocean. Earth's hydrosphere also consists of water in the atmosphere and on land, including clouds, inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft).

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi).[191] If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi).[192] About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.[193][194] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.[195] The remaining 30% is ground water, 1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land)[196] and other small forms of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere, biological binding, etc. .[197][198]

In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms.[199] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.[200]

The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[201] Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[202] The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.[203] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.[204] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.[205]

The abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water.[206] Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.[207]

Atmosphere
Main article: Atmosphere of Earth

A view of Earth with different layers of its atmosphere visible: the troposphere with its clouds casting shadows, a band of stratospheric blue sky at the horizon, and a line of green airglow of the lower thermosphere around an altitude of 100 km, at the edge of space
The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi),[208] with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi).[3] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[208] Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4%[208] but averages about 1%.[3] Clouds cover around two-thirds of Earth's surface, more so over oceans than land.[209] The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.[210]

Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.[62] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[211] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[212] This last phenomenon is the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F),[213] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[214]

Weather and climate
Main articles: Weather and Climate

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.[215] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere.[216] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.[217]

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.[218] Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[219]

Earth receives 1361 W/m2 of solar irradiance.[220][221] The amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator.[222] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.[223]

Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.[224] Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land.[225] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land.[226] Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.[227]

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.[217] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.[228]

The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.[218] The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.[229] Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.[230][231]

Upper atmosphere

Earth's atmosphere as it appears from space, as bands of different colours at the horizon. From the bottom, afterglow illuminates the troposphere in orange with silhouettes of clouds, and the stratosphere in white and blue. Next the mesosphere (pink area) extends to just below the edge of space at one hundred kilometers and the pink line of airglow of the lower thermosphere (invisible), which hosts green and red aurorae over several hundred kilometers.
The upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above the troposphere,[232] is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[212] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[233] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[234]

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[235] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.[236] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.[237] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.[238]

Life on Earth
Main articles: Biosphere and History of life

Earth is the only known place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth's life developed in Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth formed.

Earth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an overarching biosphere.[239] Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing changes like the Great Oxidation Event.[240]

Earth's life has over time greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes, which are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals.[241] The different biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths, planetary temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity. Earth's species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions. While freezing polar regions and high altitudes, or extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life.[242]

Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism.[243] Plants and other organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.[244]


A High Desert storm, sweeps across the Mojave
Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.[245] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.[246] Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.[247] Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming.[248] This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[249]


Human geography

A composite image of artificial light emissions at night on a map of Earth
Originating from earlier primates in Eastern Africa 300,000 years ago humans have since been migrating and with the advent of agriculture in the 10th millennium BC increasingly settling Earth's land.[250] In the 20th century Antarctica had been the last continent to see a first and until today limited human presence.

Human population has since the 19th century grown exponentially to seven billion in the early 2010s,[251] and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century.[252] Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa.[252]

Distribution and density of human population varies greatly around the world with the majority living in south to eastern Asia and 90% inhabiting only the Northern Hemisphere of Earth,[253] partly due to the hemispherical predominance of the world's land mass, with 68% of the world's land mass being in the Northern Hemisphere.[254] Furthermore, since the 19th century humans have increasingly converged into urban areas with the majority living in urban areas by the 21st century.[255]

Beyond Earth's surface humans have lived on a temporary basis, with only special purpose deep underground and underwater presence, and a few space stations. Human population virtually completely remains on Earth's surface, fully depending on Earth and the environment it sustains. Since the second half of the 20th century, some hundreds of humans have temporarily stayed beyond Earth, a tiny fraction of whom have reached another celestial body, the Moon.[256][257]

Earth has been subject to extensive human settlement, and humans have developed diverse societies and cultures. Most of Earth's land has been territorially claimed since the 19th century by sovereign states (countries) separated by political borders, and 205 such states exist today,[258] with only parts of Antarctica and a few small regions remaining unclaimed.[259] Most of these states together form the United Nations, the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization,[260] which extends human governance over the ocean and Antarctica, and therefore all of Earth.

Natural resources and land use
Main articles: Natural resource and Land use

Earth's land use for human agriculture
Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans.[261] Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales.[262] Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.[263] These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production.[264] Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.[265] These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.[266]

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.[267] In 2019, 39 million km2 (15 million sq mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12 million km2 (4.6 million sq mi) was shrub and grassland, 40 million km2 (15 million sq mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11 million km2 (4.2 million sq mi) were cultivated as croplands.[268] Of the 12–14% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percentage points were irrigated in 2015.[269] Humans use building materials to construct shelters.[270]

Humans and the environment
Main articles: Human impact on the environment and Climate change
The graph from 1880 to 2020 shows natural drivers exhibiting fluctuations of about 0.3 degrees Celsius. Human drivers steadily increase by 0.3 degrees over 100 years to 1980, then steeply by 0.8 degrees more over the past 40 years.
Change in average surface air temperature and drivers for that change. Human activity has caused increased temperatures, with natural forces adding some variability.[271]
Human activities have impacted Earth's environments. Through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering Earth's energy budget and climate.[248][272] It is estimated that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) warmer than the preindustrial baseline.[273] This increase in temperature, known as global warming, has contributed to the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[249]

The concept of planetary boundaries was introduced to quantify humanity's impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five have been crossed: Biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are thought to have passed the safe threshold.[274][275] As of 2018, no country meets the basic needs of its population without transgressing planetary boundaries. It is thought possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within sustainable levels of resource use.[276]

Cultural and historical viewpoint
Main articles: Earth in culture and Earth symbol

Human cultures have developed many views of the planet.[277] The standard astronomical symbols of Earth are a quartered circle, 🜨,[278] representing the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger, ♁. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity.[279] Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.[279] The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.[280][281][282]

Images of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.[283][284] In particular, this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation,[285] humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally,[286] acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth's environments.

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides.[287][288] Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.[289]

It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.[290] Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.[291][292]

 Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding ice shelves, and mapping conventions for vertical datums, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the Vector Map and Global Landcover Archived 26 March 2015 at the Wayback Machine datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.
